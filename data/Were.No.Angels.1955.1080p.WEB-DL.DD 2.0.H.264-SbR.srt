1
00:03:04,917 --> 00:03:06,957
- Celeste!
- Yeah?

2
00:03:07,128 --> 00:03:10,294
On the steamship that just arrived,
someone wishes to come ashore.

3
00:03:10,381 --> 00:03:12,837
I have orders
from the chief guard of the prison...

4
00:03:12,925 --> 00:03:16,840
I have to wait here in case the guards
wish to search along the shore.

5
00:03:16,929 --> 00:03:19,052
Three convicts escaped last night.

6
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:22,306
Do what I tell you.
You're on parole. A trustee.

7
00:03:22,685 --> 00:03:26,635
You're no better than a convict yourself,
even if you are allowed to come and go.

8
00:03:26,731 --> 00:03:30,230
One word from me, and back you go
to prison, so do what I tell you.

9
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:31,942
All right.

10
00:03:32,403 --> 00:03:34,976
Say, the three prisoners
who escaped last night...

11
00:03:35,072 --> 00:03:36,697
are they dangerous, did you hear?

12
00:03:36,782 --> 00:03:38,941
Yeah. They tried to kill a guard.

13
00:03:39,201 --> 00:03:41,871
Tried? He isn't dead?

14
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:44,490
I must be losing my strength.

15
00:03:44,582 --> 00:03:48,496
It's the prison food. Don't worry,
you'll be yourself again pretty soon.

16
00:03:48,586 --> 00:03:51,587
If we don't get caught first.
This is some escape...

17
00:03:51,672 --> 00:03:54,709
lying here in plain view,
and in prison clothes.

18
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:59,794
<i>Who will notice three more liberes
among 1,200 paroled convicts?</i>

19
00:04:00,014 --> 00:04:04,142
We look like them, they look like us.
Who'll notice three more?

20
00:04:05,686 --> 00:04:07,679
Get that snake away from me.

21
00:04:07,772 --> 00:04:11,188
Please. He'll hear you.
Adolphe's sensitive.

22
00:04:11,525 --> 00:04:14,361
- You'll make him nervous, Jules.
- I make him nervous?

23
00:04:14,445 --> 00:04:17,861
- Anyhow, he's got to eat.
- I'm hungry, too, you know.

24
00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:20,656
Let's go steal something.

25
00:04:32,255 --> 00:04:35,090
Albert! This isn't Paris.

26
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:36,585
Just one little pinch.

27
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:39,546
We could get picked up
just for the way you look.

28
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,757
They didn't come after us.

29
00:05:19,844 --> 00:05:23,888
They lose the scent when it rains.
Anyhow, we're doing fine.

30
00:05:24,307 --> 00:05:27,557
All we need now is a chance
to get out on that ship in the harbour...

31
00:05:27,643 --> 00:05:29,552
and then it's back to Paris.

32
00:05:29,645 --> 00:05:31,638
- You like that idea?
- Yeah.

33
00:05:40,698 --> 00:05:42,572
- This is for you.
- Thanks.

34
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,331
Can you direct me
to the Board of Health?

35
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:01,754
Thank you.

36
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:04,171
You off that ship in the harbour?

37
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:07,430
Medical officer. Illness aboard ship.
We have to be quarantined.

38
00:06:07,516 --> 00:06:10,885
That'll give time for any new passengers
to board the ship?

39
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,020
- You're a kind of official?
- I'm a kind of a convict.

40
00:06:16,692 --> 00:06:20,476
All three of you are convicts? Crooks?

41
00:06:21,405 --> 00:06:23,861
I'm a crook. These are murderers.

42
00:06:24,575 --> 00:06:26,947
Yes, well, I'd better get on
with my business.

43
00:06:27,036 --> 00:06:28,910
Rain's stopped. Board of Health. Very...

44
00:06:28,996 --> 00:06:30,788
- That way.
- Thank you.

45
00:06:33,209 --> 00:06:34,407
What did you get?

46
00:06:34,502 --> 00:06:37,668
Five francs. The new generation
has no idea of thrift.

47
00:06:37,755 --> 00:06:41,420
"Felix Ducotel's Syndicate
Merchandising Company, Cayenne."

48
00:06:41,884 --> 00:06:43,213
Ducotel.

49
00:06:44,512 --> 00:06:46,339
It's the general store.

50
00:06:46,555 --> 00:06:49,426
Oh, the famous Ducotel,
the one who gives credit.

51
00:06:51,143 --> 00:06:53,219
- There's no money in it.
- Wait a minute.

52
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:55,221
Why don't we deliver it
to Ducotel ourselves?

53
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:57,888
He may give us a little something
for our troubles.

54
00:06:57,984 --> 00:07:01,483
If not, we'll steal a little something
for our troubles.

55
00:07:42,612 --> 00:07:43,774
Joseph.

56
00:08:04,425 --> 00:08:06,714
Just a moment.

57
00:08:09,096 --> 00:08:11,801
Good afternoon. What may I do for you?

58
00:08:11,933 --> 00:08:14,174
Excuse me.
I thought you were a customer.

59
00:08:14,268 --> 00:08:16,261
- Letter for you.
- Thank you.

60
00:08:17,146 --> 00:08:19,933
May I give you something
for your trouble?

61
00:08:20,024 --> 00:08:22,811
- A cigar, perhaps?
- No money?

62
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:25,607
Well, business...

63
00:08:26,197 --> 00:08:27,691
Your roof, it leaks.

64
00:08:28,157 --> 00:08:30,944
I know,
and the rainy season is just beginning.

65
00:08:31,035 --> 00:08:32,743
- You should have it fixed.
- Well...

66
00:08:32,828 --> 00:08:37,656
I have an idea, a splendid idea.
These men are looking for work.

67
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,992
- Who, us?
- Work like we did in...

68
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:42,707
You'd have the best roof in Cayenne,
we will repair it.

69
00:08:42,797 --> 00:08:45,667
And maybe clean up the store a little.

70
00:08:45,841 --> 00:08:48,629
But I can't pay you.

71
00:08:49,011 --> 00:08:52,760
Just being in your beautiful store
among all these beautiful things...

72
00:08:52,848 --> 00:08:55,256
is payment enough. More than enough.

73
00:08:55,351 --> 00:08:58,850
Yeah. Nails, hammers, tarpaper,
you have these things?

74
00:08:59,313 --> 00:09:02,599
Nails are here,
and here are the tools and things and...

75
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,442
Up that ladder.

76
00:09:08,489 --> 00:09:10,363
You men know how to fix a roof?

77
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:14,862
Experts. Let the rainy season come,
you'll be dry as a bone.

78
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:16,614
And just as clean.

79
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:20,374
Around to the left.
Over by this window here.

80
00:09:39,395 --> 00:09:41,055
There's our ship.

81
00:09:41,188 --> 00:09:43,395
Tomorrow she'll have
three more passengers.

82
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:47,432
Yeah, but how about papers,
identity cards, passports?

83
00:09:48,571 --> 00:09:50,398
Just give me a good pen
and a few hours...

84
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:53,063
and I'll make you a passport
that'll take you to the moon.

85
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:55,946
Forgery's not a hobby with me.
It's an art.

86
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:59,328
We might get into trouble, you know.
Forgery's illegal.

87
00:09:59,415 --> 00:10:02,120
Everything we need is right down there.

88
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,878
As soon as it gets dark,
we'll help ourselves.

89
00:10:06,297 --> 00:10:08,088
The old man might object.

90
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:10,665
If he gets in our way,
it'll be just too bad for him.

91
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:14,840
We'll climb down off his roof and
cut his throat for a Christmas present.

92
00:10:15,723 --> 00:10:19,935
That's the kind of thing that could
make you stop believing in Santa Claus.

93
00:10:30,238 --> 00:10:32,314
Really, Felix, I don't understand you.

94
00:10:32,406 --> 00:10:35,941
I've told you a hundred times not to let
convicts wander around the store.

95
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:39,321
- They rob you blind, and you let them.
- Well, what does it matter?

96
00:10:39,413 --> 00:10:43,197
One more loss to the accounts
is like a headache to a drowning man.

97
00:10:43,292 --> 00:10:45,700
It's hardly noticeable, except to him.

98
00:10:45,795 --> 00:10:48,202
Aren't you going to finish
the year-end statement?

99
00:10:48,297 --> 00:10:51,132
- I've used up all the red ink.
- Wait till he hears that.

100
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:54,171
Well, he'll just have to understand
that the first year's business...

101
00:10:54,262 --> 00:10:55,922
is always a matter of ups and downs.

102
00:10:56,013 --> 00:10:59,014
Andre Trochard only believes in ups.
If you lose this position...

103
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,591
He'll understand, Amelie,
he won't discharge me.

104
00:11:01,686 --> 00:11:04,687
- Besides, we're related.
- Cousins. Only cousins.

105
00:11:05,314 --> 00:11:08,066
It would be better if we were brothers,
of course...

106
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:10,986
but I daresay it's too late even for that.

107
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:13,859
Felix, you'll never change.

108
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:16,445
Everything we have, our home,
everything belongs to Andre.

109
00:11:16,534 --> 00:11:19,950
The only good thing about this dreadful
place is that we're 3,000 miles away...

110
00:11:20,037 --> 00:11:21,532
from Andre Trochard.

111
00:11:21,622 --> 00:11:23,698
Amelie, I don't ask you to like him...

112
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:27,409
but when I was bankrupt in Paris,
who paid every cent I owed?

113
00:11:27,503 --> 00:11:31,002
He did. And who took your business
away from you in return for the favour?

114
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:33,795
Well, he gave me the opportunity
of running this establishment.

115
00:11:33,884 --> 00:11:37,336
And keeps threatening to throw you out
if business doesn't improve.

116
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:41,677
- I'm glad I'm not his brother.
- I didn't mean to nag or hurt you.

117
00:11:42,852 --> 00:11:46,351
That is an extremely handsome woman.
Extremely.

118
00:11:47,023 --> 00:11:50,522
I believe I'm going to think about her
before I go to sleep tonight.

119
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:53,564
If anybody thinks about her,
it's gonna be me.

120
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:57,066
She's yours. I'm sorry,
I didn't know you were interested.

121
00:11:57,158 --> 00:12:00,361
Just that I've got so fed up
with Sarah Bernhardt.

122
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:14,207
There's someone on the roof!

123
00:12:15,384 --> 00:12:16,713
What's that?

124
00:12:17,261 --> 00:12:19,384
Yes, I forgot to tell you.

125
00:12:19,555 --> 00:12:23,423
It's those convicts I told you about.
They're fixing the roof.

126
00:12:24,268 --> 00:12:28,017
I'll say one thing for crooks,
they give you an honest day's work.

127
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,404
Merry Christmas!

128
00:12:38,115 --> 00:12:39,574
Anybody here?

129
00:12:42,745 --> 00:12:44,453
<i>Madame Parole. Merry Christmas.</i>

130
00:12:44,538 --> 00:12:48,406
Merry Christmas, if you can call it that,
when it's 105 in the shade.

131
00:12:50,086 --> 00:12:51,200
I can't stay.

132
00:12:51,295 --> 00:12:54,747
I only stopped by to get a bottle
of Chartreuse for Ernest, you know.

133
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,592
It's my yearly Christmas surprise
for poor Ernest.

134
00:12:57,677 --> 00:12:59,716
He always gives me a box of biscuits.

135
00:12:59,804 --> 00:13:02,473
He eats them, of course,
and I drink the Chartreuse.

136
00:13:02,556 --> 00:13:03,588
I'll get you a bottle.

137
00:13:03,683 --> 00:13:06,719
I noticed the workmen on your roof
as I came in.

138
00:13:06,811 --> 00:13:10,227
Convicts, I see.
Very convenient and so cheap.

139
00:13:10,314 --> 00:13:12,271
Of course, you have to be careful,
don't you...

140
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:14,481
not to get a thief or a sex fiend?

141
00:13:14,569 --> 00:13:17,060
Murderers are best, I think.
They're so polite.

142
00:13:17,154 --> 00:13:18,565
I'll get you the Chartreuse.

143
00:13:18,656 --> 00:13:22,239
Would you? I do appreciate that
so much. Thank you.

144
00:13:33,296 --> 00:13:36,213
Joseph, may I dream about her?

145
00:13:38,301 --> 00:13:40,174
Plenty to dream about.

146
00:13:40,636 --> 00:13:43,637
Mine! All mine.

147
00:13:45,349 --> 00:13:47,805
<i>Chartreuse, madame. Cordezio.</i>

148
00:13:49,812 --> 00:13:53,062
You ought to have a convict
to help you in the shop, like my Octave.

149
00:13:53,149 --> 00:13:54,976
He is a perfect gem!

150
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:57,310
Of course,
he talks to himself a great deal...

151
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:59,775
but he is so clean and so neat
and so capable.

152
00:13:59,864 --> 00:14:03,399
You ought to see him sharpen knives.
He's a real expert.

153
00:14:03,492 --> 00:14:06,612
<i>- Just charge it.
- About your bill, Madame Parole.</i>

154
00:14:06,704 --> 00:14:09,658
My bill, of course. I must take a look
at my bill one of these days.

155
00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:10,828
Right after the holidays.

156
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:13,787
Remember me
to your charming daughter, Isabelle.

157
00:14:13,878 --> 00:14:16,285
What a pity she isn't married yet.

158
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:18,417
Merry Christmas.

159
00:14:23,846 --> 00:14:25,091
Goodbye.

160
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:31,393
Did you hear
what she said about Isabelle?

161
00:14:31,479 --> 00:14:32,724
Who?

162
00:14:32,855 --> 00:14:36,022
Our daughter, Isabelle. You haven't
forgotten we have a daughter?

163
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:38,646
Daughter? You mean Isabelle.

164
00:14:40,029 --> 00:14:42,698
<i>Madame Parole
made a remark about Isabelle?</i>

165
00:14:42,782 --> 00:14:44,691
About her not being married.

166
00:14:44,992 --> 00:14:46,949
Well, she's only 18.

167
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:50,786
At 18, I'd been married to you a year,
and Isabelle was already on the way.

168
00:14:50,873 --> 00:14:53,542
Now Isabelle is 18
and where is her Isabelle?

169
00:14:53,793 --> 00:14:56,414
You're confusing me.
Isabelle is missing?

170
00:14:56,504 --> 00:15:00,039
No. She's at church.
You never listen to me.

171
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:03,086
Amelie, don't be cross.

172
00:15:03,177 --> 00:15:05,882
Amelie, don't let us look
for more trouble.

173
00:15:06,055 --> 00:15:08,926
Don't be upset.
It makes me very unhappy.

174
00:15:09,016 --> 00:15:11,305
You know how miserable I get
when I'm unhappy.

175
00:15:11,394 --> 00:15:13,635
What kind of a mother would I be
if I didn't worry?

176
00:15:13,729 --> 00:15:15,389
Everything happens at once.

177
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:20,108
Poor Isabelle, the store, not one cash
sale all day, and Christmas, too.

178
00:15:20,278 --> 00:15:22,899
- Poor Isabelle?
- Yeah, she's in love with Paul.

179
00:15:22,989 --> 00:15:27,069
His nephew? Why, that is impossible.
They haven't seen each other in a year.

180
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:28,737
It was going on before we left Paris.

181
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:30,785
I thought she'd forget him
by now, but no.

182
00:15:30,871 --> 00:15:34,572
Look. Every page of her diary,
how much she loves him.

183
00:15:37,295 --> 00:15:39,583
You read her private thoughts?

184
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:43,337
Why do you think I gave her the diary?
Your button's loose.

185
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:47,545
Well, so she loves Paul. What of it?

186
00:15:47,638 --> 00:15:51,221
Do you think your cousin would allow
his nephew to marry our daughter?

187
00:15:51,309 --> 00:15:54,096
Why not?
My family is just as good as his.

188
00:15:54,854 --> 00:15:57,309
In fact, it's the same family,
now I think of it.

189
00:15:57,398 --> 00:15:59,023
You don't know Andre as well as I do.

190
00:15:59,108 --> 00:16:01,564
To him, a marriage is a business deal,
like any other.

191
00:16:01,652 --> 00:16:04,108
You give as little as you can
and get as much as possible.

192
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:06,273
And I have nothing to give. Is that it?

193
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:08,737
Only love, and that buys nothing.

194
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:13,864
You're right.
Poor Isabelle, and poor Amelie, too.

195
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:18,619
I wasn't talking about myself.
I wouldn't change you for anything.

196
00:16:18,961 --> 00:16:22,413
If I thought Isabelle would marry
someone like you, I wouldn't worry.

197
00:16:22,506 --> 00:16:26,290
The only thing I've ever done
that I'm proud of, is marrying you.

198
00:16:26,761 --> 00:16:29,252
And I don't know how I managed that.

199
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:32,426
It was my idea. I loved you, remember?

200
00:16:32,516 --> 00:16:34,343
I remember everything.

201
00:16:34,435 --> 00:16:37,721
I thought I could change the world
for you, but I failed.

202
00:16:38,022 --> 00:16:40,062
The world is still the same.

203
00:16:40,149 --> 00:16:44,313
Not quite the same. I'm grown-up,
and I have two children now.

204
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,480
Isabelle and you.

205
00:16:50,618 --> 00:16:53,535
That's more like it.
That's the way to celebrate Christmas.

206
00:16:53,621 --> 00:16:56,456
I remember Christmas, 1892,
in Marseilles.

207
00:16:56,832 --> 00:17:00,118
Terrible, wicked place,
rotten to the core...

208
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:02,660
and I enjoyed every minute of it.

209
00:17:04,048 --> 00:17:05,839
They're still at it.

210
00:17:09,553 --> 00:17:13,136
Remarkable. Married 18 years,
and in a climate like this.

211
00:17:31,867 --> 00:17:33,445
"Felix Ducotel."

212
00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:39,160
Good afternoon. What can I do for you?

213
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,622
Papa, it's me, Isabelle. Your daughter.

214
00:17:41,711 --> 00:17:45,127
Why, so it is.
I'd forgotten you were so pretty.

215
00:17:45,214 --> 00:17:47,705
You only say that
because I look like you.

216
00:17:48,426 --> 00:17:51,877
But you are pretty.
If only you weren't so shy.

217
00:17:52,013 --> 00:17:53,721
I'm never shy with you.

218
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:57,471
Maybe that's why you think I'm pretty,
and that makes me think...

219
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,849
Oh, dear, I'm getting all confused.

220
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:03,149
Papa, here's a letter for you.
It hasn't been opened.

221
00:18:03,232 --> 00:18:04,513
- A letter?
- Did you forget it?

222
00:18:04,609 --> 00:18:07,526
What letter?
Yes, the one the convicts brought.

223
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:10,812
- Convicts?
- The ones on the roof.

224
00:18:11,073 --> 00:18:14,608
- Is that you, Isabelle?
- Yes, Mama. I'm home from church.

225
00:18:19,081 --> 00:18:21,074
Everyone loved my dress.

226
00:18:21,584 --> 00:18:24,289
It makes a beautiful noise when I move.

227
00:18:25,004 --> 00:18:27,756
Father Edward frowned at me twice
in the litany.

228
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,004
Oh, dear, there's mud on the skirt.
That dreadful street!

229
00:18:32,386 --> 00:18:35,056
I'm sorry. I should have watched
where I was going...

230
00:18:35,139 --> 00:18:38,555
but I was thinking all the way home
such wonderful things.

231
00:18:38,768 --> 00:18:41,093
Do you often think of Paris, darling?

232
00:18:41,187 --> 00:18:43,594
How did you know
I was thinking of Paris?

233
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:45,183
Bend your arm.

234
00:18:45,441 --> 00:18:48,014
All the way home, it was in my heart
to go back there again.

235
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:50,269
To be there, if only for an hour.

236
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:52,272
Do you miss it so much?

237
00:18:52,907 --> 00:18:55,777
There's a reason. A special reason.

238
00:18:56,577 --> 00:18:59,662
Mama, I never told you. It's Paul.

239
00:18:59,956 --> 00:19:03,040
Paul Trochard. I'm in love with him.

240
00:19:03,376 --> 00:19:05,084
Are you really?

241
00:19:05,169 --> 00:19:08,538
Remember how I cried when we had
to leave France? Remember?

242
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:10,956
That was why, because of Paul.

243
00:19:11,509 --> 00:19:13,881
Why, I never would have guessed it.

244
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:17,421
Tell me, are you sure about
Paul loving you?

245
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:20,513
He's never written you, not one letter.

246
00:19:20,601 --> 00:19:22,309
We agreed not to.

247
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:24,601
That is,
he thought it would be best that way.

248
00:19:24,689 --> 00:19:28,473
To wait a year
and then see if we still felt the same.

249
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,147
And, Mama, I still feel the same.

250
00:19:37,118 --> 00:19:38,826
Run along, darling.

251
00:19:42,498 --> 00:19:45,997
Look at them.
They're prisoners, too, like us.

252
00:19:46,252 --> 00:19:48,790
How can people get into such a mess?

253
00:19:48,963 --> 00:19:51,205
Well, I've got a daughter about her age.

254
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:54,999
I hope she's with her mother.
A wonderful woman, her mother.

255
00:19:55,845 --> 00:19:58,336
- Wish I'd married her.
- Amelie!

256
00:19:58,848 --> 00:20:00,591
- Amelie!
- What is it?

257
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:07,347
He's here. Himself. Here in Cayenne.

258
00:20:07,982 --> 00:20:10,769
- Who?
- Cousin Andre.

259
00:20:11,277 --> 00:20:14,562
He's here on the steamship
in the harbour, in quarantine.

260
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:18,648
"And you will kindly have the goodness
to get me off this incredible tub at once.

261
00:20:18,743 --> 00:20:20,652
"Sincerely, Andre Trochard."

262
00:20:20,828 --> 00:20:24,908
And that's not all.
He's not alone. Paul is with him.

263
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:26,914
- Paul?
- They're both here.

264
00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:30,792
I wish I was a drunkard.
I wish I was dead.

265
00:20:31,297 --> 00:20:33,503
I wish I was a dead drunkard.

266
00:20:33,591 --> 00:20:36,129
I'll go down to the Board of Health
and make arrangements...

267
00:20:36,218 --> 00:20:37,487
to get him off the boat at once.

268
00:20:37,511 --> 00:20:39,006
Couldn't we get Paul ashore...

269
00:20:39,096 --> 00:20:42,014
and leave Cousin Andre where he is
till after the holiday at least?

270
00:20:42,099 --> 00:20:43,724
Well, he's thought of that.

271
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:47,558
He says he wants to spend Christmas
with us, going over the books.

272
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,568
I heard Papa.
Is there something wrong?

273
00:20:54,654 --> 00:20:57,571
Not for you, darling. For you
it's going to be a wonderful Christmas.

274
00:20:57,657 --> 00:21:00,112
- Paul is here in Cayenne.
- Paul?

275
00:21:02,703 --> 00:21:05,325
You must have prayed very hard
in church this morning.

276
00:21:05,414 --> 00:21:06,974
I can't believe he's here. You're sure?

277
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:10,991
They're going to stay with us.
I better change and get ready for them.

278
00:21:13,172 --> 00:21:16,921
"I have arrived this morning
and am being held in quarantine."

279
00:21:17,927 --> 00:21:20,762
He'll be here at least a week,
maybe more.

280
00:21:56,173 --> 00:21:58,083
Funny kind of a letter.

281
00:21:58,384 --> 00:22:01,718
Everything is going great,
and suddenly the sky falls in.

282
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:06,933
Here it is.

283
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:10,560
"Paul is my sole heir
and I have arranged a marriage...

284
00:22:10,646 --> 00:22:12,853
"with the daughter of Audibert,
the shipbuilder.

285
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:15,147
"I need ships in my business."

286
00:22:15,234 --> 00:22:17,441
We ought to do something,
but I've forgotten what.

287
00:22:17,528 --> 00:22:20,695
I read somewhere once, when a lady
faints, you should loosen her clothing.

288
00:22:20,781 --> 00:22:23,107
Well, that kind of reading
is what got you into trouble.

289
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,277
- Go get some water.
- Water, yeah.

290
00:22:27,997 --> 00:22:29,788
Water! Where's the water?

291
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:32,244
Who are you?

292
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,176
Here it is.

293
00:22:53,189 --> 00:22:54,469
Isabelle!

294
00:22:55,358 --> 00:22:57,516
There's no need to be frightened.
We were with her.

295
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:59,567
- What have you done?
- Nothing.

296
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:01,856
We were up there when it happened.

297
00:23:01,948 --> 00:23:05,233
Her father left, you gave her the letter,
she read it...

298
00:23:08,955 --> 00:23:12,406
On the second page,
the deadly paragraph.

299
00:23:15,002 --> 00:23:18,786
"He is my sole heir and I have arranged
a marriage with the daughter of..."

300
00:23:18,881 --> 00:23:20,874
Some cousin your husband's got.

301
00:23:20,967 --> 00:23:24,003
When she opens her eyes,
it might be better if she saw you first.

302
00:23:24,095 --> 00:23:28,757
Not that we're so very bad to look at, but
it takes a little time to get used to us.

303
00:23:29,183 --> 00:23:31,140
Darling. My darling Isabelle.

304
00:23:31,435 --> 00:23:33,724
- Paul?
- Hi!

305
00:23:39,068 --> 00:23:40,811
All I did was smile.

306
00:23:42,029 --> 00:23:44,318
- That's enough.
- She must have a weak stomach.

307
00:23:44,407 --> 00:23:45,782
What'll I do with her?

308
00:23:45,866 --> 00:23:48,702
- Would you take her to her bedroom?
- Sure.

309
00:23:48,911 --> 00:23:50,405
It's right this way.

310
00:23:56,085 --> 00:23:58,872
It's right through these doors, this way.

311
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:02,084
My dear!

312
00:24:04,427 --> 00:24:06,419
- It's right this way.
- Sure.

313
00:24:06,804 --> 00:24:08,085
In here.

314
00:24:08,973 --> 00:24:12,258
Thank you. I'll get the smelling salts.

315
00:24:15,187 --> 00:24:18,603
- It might be a good idea if you...
- If I...

316
00:24:18,816 --> 00:24:20,275
It certainly would.

317
00:24:26,324 --> 00:24:28,032
Your friends are very obliging...

318
00:24:28,117 --> 00:24:29,991
especially the one
who carried my daughter.

319
00:24:30,077 --> 00:24:32,117
How did he get into trouble?

320
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:33,996
Running after a girl.

321
00:24:34,248 --> 00:24:37,333
Running after a girl?
Is that a crime in France?

322
00:24:37,627 --> 00:24:41,459
No, not exactly.
Unfortunately, he caught her.

323
00:24:41,756 --> 00:24:45,089
That's all right. Jules is there, too.

324
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:47,590
All he ever did was kill his wife.

325
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:52,099
But you're supposed to
when a girl faints.

326
00:24:52,433 --> 00:24:54,889
You shouldn't go in, ma'am,
she's crying and...

327
00:24:54,977 --> 00:24:56,471
My poor daughter.

328
00:24:57,813 --> 00:24:59,687
Good heavens, a customer.

329
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,691
At a time like this.

330
00:25:03,194 --> 00:25:06,278
Anytime's the right time for a customer.
May I?

331
00:25:06,364 --> 00:25:09,234
It would be a treat for me.
It's been so long.

332
00:25:11,619 --> 00:25:13,576
He'll wait on your customer, madam.

333
00:25:13,663 --> 00:25:17,114
He is a kind of genius, you know,
he once swindled nine million francs...

334
00:25:17,208 --> 00:25:19,082
and you don't meet a man like that
every day.

335
00:25:19,168 --> 00:25:23,332
I suppose not, but after all,
having a convict wait on a customer...

336
00:25:24,048 --> 00:25:26,669
- We make you nervous?
- I guess you do.

337
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:28,119
There's no need to worry, madam...

338
00:25:28,177 --> 00:25:31,926
although, of course, none of us went
to jail for biting our nails.

339
00:25:32,098 --> 00:25:34,174
I had a perfectly
wonderful career myself.

340
00:25:34,267 --> 00:25:35,512
He cracked safes.

341
00:25:35,601 --> 00:25:38,306
- I only made one small mistake.
- What was that?

342
00:25:38,563 --> 00:25:41,350
A slight difference of opinion
with my wife.

343
00:25:43,651 --> 00:25:47,020
Look at this beautiful silver comb
and brush set, it was made for you.

344
00:25:47,113 --> 00:25:49,983
Do you know how lucky you are?
This is the last one we have.

345
00:25:50,074 --> 00:25:51,734
- What'll I do with it?
- Exercise.

346
00:25:51,826 --> 00:25:55,076
It will be good for you. Besides,
just having it around will fool everyone.

347
00:25:55,162 --> 00:25:57,072
You can leave it to your family someday.

348
00:25:57,164 --> 00:25:59,738
- I have no family.
- That's just the point.

349
00:25:59,875 --> 00:26:03,659
Only the other day, I sold a duplicate set
to a completely baldheaded man...

350
00:26:03,754 --> 00:26:05,664
- and you should see him now.
- What happened?

351
00:26:05,756 --> 00:26:08,508
He died,
but he died with beautiful, bushy hair.

352
00:26:08,593 --> 00:26:10,170
I'll get your change.

353
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,969
Can you change this?
I've just taken in 117 francs.

354
00:26:19,061 --> 00:26:21,896
- What did you sell?
- Sterling silver comb and brush set.

355
00:26:21,981 --> 00:26:25,350
But that's been there for 10 years.
Who did you sell it to?

356
00:26:25,568 --> 00:26:27,560
He said he was the postmaster.

357
00:26:27,695 --> 00:26:30,981
The postmaster? He's entirely bald.

358
00:26:31,449 --> 00:26:33,737
Then we'd better hurry
before he finds out.

359
00:26:33,826 --> 00:26:35,985
Oh, dear. My husband has the key.

360
00:26:36,746 --> 00:26:37,944
Well, allow me.

361
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:42,167
It's been a long time but I'm sure
the old maestro retains his touch.

362
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:48,796
I can only do this in the dark,
so quiet, please.

363
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,590
Thank you!

364
00:27:02,855 --> 00:27:05,263
You're quite sure
it was the postmaster?

365
00:27:05,358 --> 00:27:06,603
He wanted a bedspread.

366
00:27:06,692 --> 00:27:08,234
And you sold him
a comb and brush set?

367
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:10,110
There wasn't any bedspread.

368
00:27:11,948 --> 00:27:14,984
- Are there many like you in...
- Yes. There are all sorts.

369
00:27:15,076 --> 00:27:16,736
It's a world like any other.

370
00:27:16,827 --> 00:27:19,449
But to sell silver
and look after fainting girls...

371
00:27:19,538 --> 00:27:22,409
It's an old family custom,
carrying girls around.

372
00:27:25,586 --> 00:27:28,671
Sold him some hair tonic, too.
11 francs.

373
00:27:29,298 --> 00:27:30,627
Thank you.

374
00:27:32,802 --> 00:27:34,794
Well, back to the roof.

375
00:27:36,138 --> 00:27:37,798
Where's Adolphe?

376
00:27:39,475 --> 00:27:41,183
There are four of you?

377
00:27:42,645 --> 00:27:46,263
In a way, yes. Adolphe is
a small snake in a little cage.

378
00:27:46,732 --> 00:27:49,140
Like us, an exile and a prisoner.

379
00:27:49,569 --> 00:27:52,439
- Adolphe did us a favour once.
- A big favour.

380
00:27:52,947 --> 00:27:54,738
We used to be watched over
by a guard...

381
00:27:54,824 --> 00:27:57,030
who was a disagreeable fellow
with a whip.

382
00:27:57,118 --> 00:27:59,656
One day, he was shouting
in a particularly nasty way...

383
00:27:59,745 --> 00:28:03,079
and it must have been a note
in his voice which irritated Adolphe...

384
00:28:03,165 --> 00:28:06,036
because, you know,
vipers are very musical reptiles...

385
00:28:06,127 --> 00:28:08,084
they're much more musical
than people think.

386
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:12,299
And anyway,
the snake lost his patience...

387
00:28:12,717 --> 00:28:15,338
fell into the gap
between the guard's collar...

388
00:28:15,428 --> 00:28:17,467
and, I suppose, it would be the neck...

389
00:28:17,555 --> 00:28:18,835
and...

390
00:28:20,683 --> 00:28:22,510
It was a matter of seconds.

391
00:28:22,643 --> 00:28:24,435
It was also quite a favour.

392
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:27,355
Yes, he was a much nicer guard
after that.

393
00:28:29,191 --> 00:28:30,472
Horrible.

394
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:34,023
No, I guess it's not your kind of story.

395
00:28:38,242 --> 00:28:40,151
Don't move, young lady.

396
00:28:41,996 --> 00:28:44,701
- I found this in my room.
- I said, don't move.

397
00:28:46,876 --> 00:28:47,990
What is it?

398
00:28:48,085 --> 00:28:50,045
He might have bit you.
He doesn't know any better.

399
00:28:50,129 --> 00:28:51,588
It's a snake, see?

400
00:28:53,883 --> 00:28:56,374
My daughter, my poor daughter.

401
00:28:56,469 --> 00:28:59,042
It must be her day
for being unconscious.

402
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:01,423
Where would you like her
this time, madam?

403
00:29:01,515 --> 00:29:03,473
Same place.

404
00:29:04,977 --> 00:29:06,537
You ought to get her out of that habit.

405
00:29:06,604 --> 00:29:09,521
Falling over like that,
she might break something.

406
00:29:16,822 --> 00:29:18,422
Come on.
There's nobody in the store now.

407
00:29:18,449 --> 00:29:19,908
Let's take inventory.

408
00:29:19,992 --> 00:29:21,985
Pick out something nice for me.

409
00:30:13,796 --> 00:30:15,539
Let's put her away.

410
00:30:15,965 --> 00:30:17,210
No, spare her.

411
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:20,835
Take my money. Take everything I have,
but spare my wife!

412
00:30:29,812 --> 00:30:31,437
You need glasses.

413
00:30:32,231 --> 00:30:35,268
The last time I saw you men,
you were on the roof.

414
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:37,482
What happened? Did it fall in?

415
00:30:37,653 --> 00:30:40,144
- Back from the Board of Health?
- Yes.

416
00:30:40,448 --> 00:30:42,156
What about cousin Andre?

417
00:30:42,241 --> 00:30:44,448
They won't let him off the ship
until tomorrow.

418
00:30:44,535 --> 00:30:45,780
That's nice.

419
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:48,028
What are you doing with my accounts?

420
00:30:48,122 --> 00:30:52,167
Accounts? You call this mess
of unrelated mathematics "accounts"?

421
00:30:52,251 --> 00:30:55,288
I got 10 years
for a better set of books than these.

422
00:30:55,379 --> 00:30:57,206
Where are the smelling salts?
Thank you.

423
00:30:57,298 --> 00:30:59,623
Amelie, I don't understand it.

424
00:30:59,717 --> 00:31:02,386
Convicts working on my books,
others doing other things.

425
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:05,886
When you hear what's been going on
you'll want to thank these gentlemen.

426
00:31:05,973 --> 00:31:08,927
- Isabelle read the letter.
- About Paul getting married?

427
00:31:09,018 --> 00:31:10,393
Yes. Come on.

428
00:31:14,023 --> 00:31:16,181
These people got enough trouble
without us.

429
00:31:16,275 --> 00:31:19,193
Maybe we ought to give up the idea
of robbing them and clear out.

430
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:20,357
You getting soft?

431
00:31:20,446 --> 00:31:23,019
You may like the idea
of going back to the cages. Not me.

432
00:31:23,115 --> 00:31:26,200
I still think we ought to escape,
but taking advantage of them, no.

433
00:31:26,285 --> 00:31:28,693
It makes me feel like a criminal.

434
00:31:29,205 --> 00:31:31,447
We're going up
on the roof and wait till dark.

435
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:32,821
Couldn't we wait just a minute?

436
00:31:32,917 --> 00:31:35,834
That girl,
I'd like to see her with her eyes open.

437
00:31:36,545 --> 00:31:38,205
Another customer.

438
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:44,042
That's his life,
selling people things they don't want...

439
00:31:44,136 --> 00:31:46,046
for more than they can afford to pay.

440
00:31:46,138 --> 00:31:49,092
- If we're leaving, we ought to leave.
- I wouldn't mind staying.

441
00:31:49,183 --> 00:31:52,303
Christmas has always been
a very special holiday for me.

442
00:31:52,395 --> 00:31:56,060
That's how I got into trouble. I came
home unexpectedly one Christmas...

443
00:31:56,148 --> 00:31:59,434
and found my wife
giving a friend of mine a present.

444
00:31:59,694 --> 00:32:01,982
Too bad. I'm sorry to hear that, Jules.

445
00:32:02,071 --> 00:32:03,565
It was my own fault entirely.

446
00:32:03,656 --> 00:32:06,325
I should have written,
told her I was coming.

447
00:32:08,452 --> 00:32:09,733
It's too tight.

448
00:32:09,829 --> 00:32:12,071
Yes, it is a little snug.

449
00:32:12,331 --> 00:32:15,036
Well, I'll get a larger one from stock.

450
00:32:17,003 --> 00:32:19,126
I'll be back in 10 seconds.

451
00:32:28,556 --> 00:32:30,299
What are you doing?

452
00:32:30,391 --> 00:32:32,549
The customs inspector
wants a larger size.

453
00:32:32,643 --> 00:32:34,221
That's the only size there is.

454
00:32:34,312 --> 00:32:37,894
- I know. I'll just take this one back.
- But it's the wrong size.

455
00:32:37,982 --> 00:32:40,983
I don't sell a piece of goods.
I sell an idea.

456
00:32:44,572 --> 00:32:46,944
You know how lucky you are?
This is the last one we have.

457
00:32:47,033 --> 00:32:48,064
Thank you.

458
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:50,317
There you are.

459
00:32:50,912 --> 00:32:53,747
Now pull yourself in just a little.

460
00:32:54,248 --> 00:32:56,786
A little more. Yes, that's better.

461
00:32:57,793 --> 00:33:00,711
No stomach at all. Stop breathing.

462
00:33:01,631 --> 00:33:03,125
That shoulder line.

463
00:33:03,215 --> 00:33:06,834
A man with beautiful shoulders
like yours shouldn't try to hide them.

464
00:33:06,928 --> 00:33:10,462
You're breathing again.
That's better. What a difference.

465
00:33:10,806 --> 00:33:14,555
Two sizes larger makes you look
10 years younger. It's remarkable.

466
00:33:14,644 --> 00:33:15,924
Thank you.

467
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:20,103
It's supposed to be a two-button jacket.
Well, come again.

468
00:33:21,609 --> 00:33:24,645
- Thank you.
- I like this coat. It's nice and breezy.

469
00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:29,282
- He took it.
- Why not? It fits perfectly...

470
00:33:29,367 --> 00:33:32,403
so long as he doesn't put anything
into the pockets or lean over.

471
00:33:32,495 --> 00:33:37,121
You better put this in that cashbox of
yours, so we know it's in a safe place.

472
00:33:37,667 --> 00:33:39,375
We're nearly finished.

473
00:33:40,628 --> 00:33:42,288
I'll give you a hand.

474
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:47,425
One moment.

475
00:33:47,927 --> 00:33:50,714
My wife has told me
how helpful you were.

476
00:33:51,222 --> 00:33:53,629
You know, this is Christmas Eve...

477
00:33:54,058 --> 00:33:56,929
and my wife thought,
and I agreed with her...

478
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:00,640
that is, if you have nothing else to do...

479
00:34:00,731 --> 00:34:03,269
Are you asking us to stay
for Christmas dinner?

480
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:06,276
No matter what else we have to do,
we accept.

481
00:34:07,863 --> 00:34:09,488
I'm so happy.

482
00:34:11,158 --> 00:34:13,994
I'd hoped I might be able
to persuade you.

483
00:34:14,078 --> 00:34:16,569
Of course, they may be waiting for you
at the prison.

484
00:34:16,664 --> 00:34:19,831
- You can be sure of that.
- Let them wait. It's very good for them.

485
00:34:19,917 --> 00:34:21,495
Yes. They get their own way so often.

486
00:34:21,586 --> 00:34:23,874
Anyhow, the way your daughter
keeps passing out...

487
00:34:23,963 --> 00:34:26,335
you'll need somebody
to carry her back and forth.

488
00:34:26,424 --> 00:34:30,504
Then it's settled. I'll tell my wife
I was able to talk you into staying.

489
00:34:31,512 --> 00:34:35,095
We'll make a real Christmas of it with
a tree and decorations and presents.

490
00:34:35,182 --> 00:34:37,590
You guys get everything ready,
I'll go buy a turkey.

491
00:34:37,685 --> 00:34:40,437
- Did you say "buy"?
- In honour of the season.

492
00:34:41,272 --> 00:34:45,020
It may take a little while.
First I have to steal the money.

493
00:35:01,042 --> 00:35:02,240
What...

494
00:35:02,335 --> 00:35:05,336
Nervous stomach.
Always happens before a meal.

495
00:35:14,931 --> 00:35:16,473
We need some flowers.

496
00:35:16,724 --> 00:35:19,013
Like in the Governor's garden?

497
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:22,394
And don't step on the grass.

498
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,180
Of course not. What do you take
me for? Stepping on the grass...

499
00:35:44,252 --> 00:35:45,746
Need any help?

500
00:35:46,754 --> 00:35:48,581
It's you, one of the convicts.

501
00:35:48,673 --> 00:35:52,006
The one who's been carrying you
around all afternoon.

502
00:35:52,301 --> 00:35:54,009
You going someplace?

503
00:35:55,012 --> 00:35:56,756
I'm going to kill myself.

504
00:35:58,557 --> 00:36:02,176
When you're 60, you'll wear a hat like
that so men won't look at your face.

505
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:04,511
Not now. You've got a nice face.

506
00:36:04,605 --> 00:36:06,562
How can I run away without a hat?

507
00:36:06,649 --> 00:36:09,057
Why run away,
'cause you're mad at Paul?

508
00:36:09,652 --> 00:36:12,688
We were on the roof.
We know all about you and Paul.

509
00:36:14,282 --> 00:36:16,607
Well, then you know
why I'm running away.

510
00:36:16,701 --> 00:36:19,405
Why would Paul come here
unless it was to see you again?

511
00:36:19,495 --> 00:36:21,155
His uncle made him come.

512
00:36:21,622 --> 00:36:26,249
No. I bet there's another reason. I bet
he came so that you two could elope.

513
00:36:27,837 --> 00:36:29,545
That isn't very likely, is it?

514
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:32,750
A man doesn't travel 4,000 miles
just to prove he's a louse.

515
00:36:32,842 --> 00:36:35,759
He could do that in a letter,
like I always did.

516
00:36:38,139 --> 00:36:40,760
It's funny, but I want to believe you.

517
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:42,309
Yeah, I thought you might.

518
00:36:42,393 --> 00:36:45,727
The least you can do
is wait for Paul's side of the story.

519
00:36:46,564 --> 00:36:50,015
The thing that really bothers me,
about Paul, I mean, is...

520
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:53,527
I wouldn't blame him
for not wanting me.

521
00:36:53,613 --> 00:36:57,231
I know I'm sort of awkward.
I've never been attractive to men.

522
00:36:57,325 --> 00:36:58,653
I'm a man.

523
00:36:59,952 --> 00:37:01,494
You find me...

524
00:37:01,913 --> 00:37:05,032
That is, do I seem to you? Well, do I?

525
00:37:05,708 --> 00:37:08,199
I could go to jail for the way I feel...

526
00:37:08,461 --> 00:37:10,500
if I wasn't there already.

527
00:37:11,172 --> 00:37:15,501
Now put a pretty smile on your face
and don't hurt the people you love.

528
00:37:16,844 --> 00:37:19,216
- You're amazing.
- Why?

529
00:37:20,348 --> 00:37:23,514
Because of these?
I wasn't born in a cell, you know.

530
00:37:23,601 --> 00:37:25,640
You don't look like a criminal to me.

531
00:37:25,728 --> 00:37:29,393
If crime showed on a man's face,
there wouldn't be any mirrors.

532
00:37:31,817 --> 00:37:32,980
May I?

533
00:37:38,658 --> 00:37:41,777
- How do you like the way we fixed it up?
- It's pretty.

534
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:47,950
You know, I've forgotten
which side the knives go on.

535
00:37:48,042 --> 00:37:50,165
- Here. I'll help you.
- Sure.

536
00:37:52,088 --> 00:37:56,548
You were saying something before.
I don't exactly remember what it was...

537
00:37:57,176 --> 00:38:00,260
but something about me being attractive
or something like that.

538
00:38:00,346 --> 00:38:03,051
Very attractive. And believe me, I know.

539
00:38:03,724 --> 00:38:06,595
That's how I got into trouble,
over a woman.

540
00:38:06,852 --> 00:38:09,426
I needed money,
and my uncle wouldn't give me any.

541
00:38:09,522 --> 00:38:12,357
They sent you to jail because
you asked your uncle for money?

542
00:38:12,441 --> 00:38:14,315
It was the way I asked.

543
00:38:15,903 --> 00:38:19,983
At the trial, it was established
I hit him over the head 14 times.

544
00:38:20,908 --> 00:38:24,158
<i>- How could you do it?
- With a poker, mademoiselle.</i>

545
00:38:29,584 --> 00:38:31,825
Anyway, that's all over now...

546
00:38:32,336 --> 00:38:35,456
and we were talking
about something else, remember?

547
00:38:35,548 --> 00:38:37,624
About me being the way you said.

548
00:38:39,385 --> 00:38:42,552
Do you really think
I'm attractive to gentlemen?

549
00:38:48,853 --> 00:38:52,186
I think we need
some more cups and saucers.

550
00:39:01,115 --> 00:39:04,199
You must be feeling better, darling.
Your colour's coming back.

551
00:39:04,285 --> 00:39:06,776
I've never been so happy in my life.

552
00:39:15,379 --> 00:39:18,831
- You have on my apron.
- It's all I could find.

553
00:39:21,302 --> 00:39:25,300
I don't mind. It looks very nice on you.
Pink suits you well.

554
00:39:25,473 --> 00:39:29,138
- You like me in pink?
- It brings out the colour in your eyes.

555
00:39:35,149 --> 00:39:36,643
Say something.

556
00:39:37,485 --> 00:39:41,648
- Go ahead. Say anything at all.
- I've got nothing to say, nothing at all.

557
00:39:41,906 --> 00:39:43,530
- Except...
- Except what?

558
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:45,027
Joseph, it's true.

559
00:39:45,117 --> 00:39:49,032
It does bring out the colour
in your beautiful, big, brown eyes.

560
00:39:50,414 --> 00:39:52,288
Oh, to be a painter!

561
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:14,145
What a beautiful turkey.
Where'd you get it?

562
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:16,222
It followed me against my will.

563
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:19,728
Look at all this.

564
00:40:21,112 --> 00:40:23,437
How did a man like you get here?

565
00:40:23,531 --> 00:40:25,488
It was easy. I had an air factory.

566
00:40:25,575 --> 00:40:29,026
We sold bottled air to people whose
doctors advised a change of climate.

567
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,196
We had three kinds:
Sea air, mountain air...

568
00:40:31,289 --> 00:40:33,530
and all-purpose air just for breathing.

569
00:40:33,624 --> 00:40:36,459
- We had a very low overhead.
- At least you had courage.

570
00:40:36,544 --> 00:40:38,168
It didn't take courage to go to jail.

571
00:40:38,254 --> 00:40:41,089
Just a certain amount of larceny
and a little bad luck.

572
00:40:41,173 --> 00:40:42,549
You did what you wanted.

573
00:40:42,633 --> 00:40:45,041
What I wanted
was always against the law.

574
00:40:45,136 --> 00:40:48,671
I mean, speaking for myself,
I got out of school, got married...

575
00:40:48,764 --> 00:40:53,011
and then nearly 20 years went by,
dull, uneventful years.

576
00:40:53,144 --> 00:40:55,386
Ten of those years I spent in prison.

577
00:40:55,479 --> 00:40:57,686
You'd be surprised
how little happens in prison.

578
00:40:57,773 --> 00:41:00,395
They make an effort
not to have it too exciting.

579
00:41:00,484 --> 00:41:04,150
- If you could do it all over again...
- I'd do exactly the same.

580
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:07,982
To me, the only mistake I ever made
was getting caught.

581
00:41:08,367 --> 00:41:11,072
Well, after all you've been through,
you and the others...

582
00:41:11,162 --> 00:41:15,539
it's very nice of you to help us, and
Isabelle, a girl you've never seen. Why?

583
00:41:16,584 --> 00:41:18,790
She reminds Juley of his youth...

584
00:41:18,878 --> 00:41:21,914
me of the home and family I never had,
and Albert...

585
00:41:22,757 --> 00:41:24,584
Albert is a swine.

586
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,510
Amelie, where did we get a turkey?

587
00:41:33,601 --> 00:41:36,092
It followed him, against his will.

588
00:41:41,734 --> 00:41:45,103
- I'll get some wine to go with dinner.
- Richebourg would be nice.

589
00:41:45,196 --> 00:41:48,316
Not with turkey. Chateau d'Yquem '88.

590
00:41:48,407 --> 00:41:49,985
Chateau d'Yquem?

591
00:41:50,952 --> 00:41:53,988
Conditions at the prison
must be better than I thought.

592
00:42:07,885 --> 00:42:12,179
- What is that pitiful object?
- The Christmas tree! I forgot the angels.

593
00:42:13,015 --> 00:42:17,428
Here it is. The three angels. It was
on the first Christmas tree I ever had.

594
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:21,814
It wouldn't be Christmas without them.
See? Just like in the carol.

595
00:42:22,567 --> 00:42:26,813
"Three angels came to earth that night
And all around the stars were bright"

596
00:42:27,488 --> 00:42:28,863
I remember.

597
00:42:30,116 --> 00:42:33,033
Your angels didn't stand
the trip very well.

598
00:42:33,578 --> 00:42:35,404
Their wings are a little damaged.

599
00:42:35,496 --> 00:42:37,204
The feathers are all gone.

600
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:39,697
And they don't have halos either.

601
00:42:39,875 --> 00:42:43,209
Yes, they do. They have halos.
To me, anyway.

602
00:42:43,671 --> 00:42:47,289
And their wings are perfect,
and their feathers are snowy white...

603
00:42:47,383 --> 00:42:51,594
and they came down from the stars,
even if it seemed like only the roof.

604
00:43:15,369 --> 00:43:18,489
- Yes, but don't step on the grass.
- Certainly not.

605
00:43:33,429 --> 00:43:35,718
- For the ladies.
- Thank you.

606
00:43:48,027 --> 00:43:49,355
I'm ready.

607
00:43:54,742 --> 00:43:56,070
Thank you.

608
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:01,157
Right this way, please.
This way to Christmas.

609
00:44:12,468 --> 00:44:13,583
Isn't it beautiful?

610
00:44:13,678 --> 00:44:17,510
What lovely flowers,
just like those in the Governor's garden.

611
00:44:40,121 --> 00:44:43,287
Turkey Ducotel, sauce Isabelle...

612
00:44:43,499 --> 00:44:45,824
<i>garni а la guillotine.</i>

613
00:44:58,806 --> 00:44:59,969
Look!

614
00:45:01,309 --> 00:45:04,559
- What a beautiful tree.
- Why, it's grown!

615
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:19,277
<i>All the stars shone heavenly bright</i>

616
00:45:19,702 --> 00:45:24,411
<i>Shepherds marvelled at the sight</i>

617
00:45:24,749 --> 00:45:29,327
<i>And three angels came that night</i>

618
00:45:29,545 --> 00:45:34,456
<i>Clothed in robes of gleaming white</i>

619
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:39,712
<i>Bringing tidings of good cheer</i>

620
00:45:40,097 --> 00:45:46,017
<i>For the Christmas morn was near</i>

621
00:46:09,001 --> 00:46:10,543
Come on, Paul.

622
00:46:14,423 --> 00:46:17,757
How much will you charge me
to drive us to the store of Felix Ducotel?

623
00:46:17,843 --> 00:46:20,548
<i>This time of night, Christmas Eve,
eight francs, monsieur.</i>

624
00:46:20,638 --> 00:46:21,883
I'll give you three francs.

625
00:46:21,973 --> 00:46:24,677
<i>But three francs
won't feed my horse, monsieur.</i>

626
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:28,302
Your horse's eating habits
are of no concern to me. Drive on!

627
00:46:29,605 --> 00:46:31,183
Giddap!

628
00:46:38,948 --> 00:46:41,190
I hope this is a vintage year.

629
00:46:42,159 --> 00:46:45,279
Bottled in 1888, the same year as me.

630
00:46:46,038 --> 00:46:47,580
Merry Christmas, gentlemen.

631
00:46:47,665 --> 00:46:49,408
Merry Christmas.

632
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:52,870
<i>Sentimental moments</i>

633
00:46:54,255 --> 00:46:57,671
<i>Moments that you shared with me</i>

634
00:46:58,843 --> 00:47:04,133
<i>They will last forever and ever and ever</i>

635
00:47:04,765 --> 00:47:07,969
<i>In my memory</i>

636
00:47:09,937 --> 00:47:13,223
<i>Sentimental moments</i>

637
00:47:14,150 --> 00:47:17,768
<i>How I treasure every one</i>

638
00:47:18,571 --> 00:47:24,443
<i>And I live them over and over and over</i>

639
00:47:24,911 --> 00:47:27,746
<i>When my day is done</i>

640
00:47:29,206 --> 00:47:32,124
<i>Those happy endless walks</i>

641
00:47:32,209 --> 00:47:33,752
<i>The quiet talks</i>

642
00:47:34,045 --> 00:47:36,084
<i>The music</i>

643
00:47:36,756 --> 00:47:40,800
<i>The crazy things that lovers do</i>

644
00:47:41,093 --> 00:47:45,672
<i>When love is new</i>

645
00:47:46,974 --> 00:47:50,557
<i>Sentimental moments</i>

646
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:55,565
<i>Share them once again with me</i>

647
00:47:56,317 --> 00:48:01,442
<i>And they'll bring us closer and closer</i>

648
00:48:01,530 --> 00:48:03,737
<i>And closer</i>

649
00:48:04,325 --> 00:48:08,536
<i>Like we used to be</i>

650
00:48:20,841 --> 00:48:23,759
My wife thought, and so did I...

651
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:28,087
we didn't have time
to pick anything out for you...

652
00:48:28,683 --> 00:48:32,467
Christmas presents, that is.
We wanted to...

653
00:48:32,687 --> 00:48:35,522
Well, Merry Christmas.

654
00:48:44,532 --> 00:48:47,319
It's getting late. I think we better...

655
00:48:48,369 --> 00:48:51,240
- Good night. Merry Christmas.
- Thank you for the party.

656
00:48:51,330 --> 00:48:52,659
Good night.

657
00:48:58,546 --> 00:49:02,129
People like that,
how can you cut their throats?

658
00:49:02,383 --> 00:49:03,877
It isn't easy.

659
00:49:04,552 --> 00:49:07,043
No one's been nice to me since...

660
00:49:07,179 --> 00:49:10,548
October, 1891.

661
00:49:14,145 --> 00:49:16,137
If only they didn't trust us.

662
00:49:16,397 --> 00:49:19,600
It isn't fair. Here we are,
three desperate criminals...

663
00:49:19,692 --> 00:49:22,230
who'll stop at nothing
to escape from Devil's Island...

664
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:24,561
and we have to fall in with nice people.

665
00:49:24,655 --> 00:49:27,193
You guys act like
you don't want to cut their throats.

666
00:49:27,283 --> 00:49:29,904
Speaking for myself,
I'd just as soon not.

667
00:49:29,994 --> 00:49:32,781
After all, it might spoil their Christmas.

668
00:49:34,707 --> 00:49:37,578
I don't care how nice they are.
They're not going to soften me up.

669
00:49:37,668 --> 00:49:39,577
We're escaping
and this is our only chance.

670
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:42,208
We came here to rob them,
and that's what we're gonna do.

671
00:49:42,298 --> 00:49:45,797
Beat their heads in,
gouge their eyes out, cut their throats.

672
00:49:46,552 --> 00:49:48,759
As soon as we wash the dishes.

673
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:11,823
Hello!

674
00:50:12,370 --> 00:50:14,777
- Can't be a customer.
- Santa Claus.

675
00:50:39,397 --> 00:50:40,642
Convicts.

676
00:50:41,566 --> 00:50:43,642
What are you doing here
on Christmas Eve?

677
00:50:43,734 --> 00:50:45,727
We're the three wise men.

678
00:50:46,946 --> 00:50:50,611
Look at pretty boy here.
This must be Paul and Cousin Andre.

679
00:50:51,158 --> 00:50:54,195
How did you get out of quarantine,
a little bribery?

680
00:51:00,835 --> 00:51:04,418
Well, there goes Christmas
right out the window.

681
00:51:05,089 --> 00:51:07,129
I thought I heard someone...

682
00:51:08,593 --> 00:51:10,253
Why, Cousin Andre.

683
00:51:10,886 --> 00:51:12,511
Quite a welcome.

684
00:51:12,847 --> 00:51:15,764
Twenty-four hours in port
on an overheated ship...

685
00:51:15,850 --> 00:51:18,602
eight hours trying to convince
an idiotic witch doctor...

686
00:51:18,686 --> 00:51:21,094
that I've never been exposed
to the bubonic plague.

687
00:51:21,188 --> 00:51:23,181
And when I finally come ashore...

688
00:51:23,274 --> 00:51:27,568
I'm greeted by a reception committee
from the penitentiary.

689
00:51:27,862 --> 00:51:30,531
Friends, no doubt?
Guests for the evening?

690
00:51:30,865 --> 00:51:33,356
- As a matter of fact...
- We work here.

691
00:51:34,076 --> 00:51:36,864
I don't recall asking you,
but if you work here, then work.

692
00:51:36,954 --> 00:51:38,532
Get our luggage.

693
00:51:43,044 --> 00:51:46,495
- You remember Paul, of course.
- Paul. Of course.

694
00:51:47,131 --> 00:51:50,714
We didn't expect you until tomorrow.
Your rooms aren't ready.

695
00:51:50,801 --> 00:51:53,209
Then get them ready! I'm hot and tired.

696
00:51:53,304 --> 00:51:55,047
At once. Of course.

697
00:51:56,140 --> 00:51:58,180
Amelie! Isabelle!

698
00:51:58,267 --> 00:52:00,758
- This guy's my meat.
- Things are picking up, all right.

699
00:52:00,853 --> 00:52:04,020
I was getting bored myself,
everybody being nice to everybody else.

700
00:52:04,106 --> 00:52:05,649
This is more like it.

701
00:52:05,733 --> 00:52:10,062
Passports, clothes, money. Everything
we need, even steamship tickets.

702
00:52:10,363 --> 00:52:12,106
What a Christmas present.

703
00:52:13,491 --> 00:52:15,863
Andre, I'm sorry we weren't ready.

704
00:52:15,952 --> 00:52:17,612
You're always sorry.
You'll never change.

705
00:52:17,703 --> 00:52:18,984
I'm sorry.

706
00:52:20,289 --> 00:52:23,990
These jailbirds look dangerous.
But I daresay you always go armed.

707
00:52:24,085 --> 00:52:25,247
No.

708
00:52:25,544 --> 00:52:30,088
Well, I intend to sleep with a pistol
in my hand. Keep that in mind.

709
00:52:31,384 --> 00:52:32,926
- Come along, Andre.
- Thank you.

710
00:52:33,010 --> 00:52:36,510
Amelie has your room ready.
Careful with that. Don't let it fall.

711
00:52:36,597 --> 00:52:38,091
Easy, man. Easy.

712
00:52:42,687 --> 00:52:45,225
- Amelie, Isabelle, Andre and Paul.
- Oh, good evening.

713
00:52:45,314 --> 00:52:47,223
Good evening, Amelie.
Good evening, Isabelle.

714
00:52:47,316 --> 00:52:49,938
Good evening.
Did you have a nice trip, Cousin Andre?

715
00:52:50,027 --> 00:52:51,438
Are you trying to be funny?

716
00:52:51,529 --> 00:52:54,150
Your rooms are just about ready.
We're moving out to the stable.

717
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:57,276
- Please, no details. I'm not interested.
- Excuse me.

718
00:52:58,995 --> 00:53:02,862
- I'm so happy to see you again, Paul.
- It's good to see you, Isabelle.

719
00:53:02,957 --> 00:53:04,700
- Paul.
- Yes, Uncle.

720
00:53:04,834 --> 00:53:07,455
You'll oblige me
by going to bed immediately.

721
00:53:07,545 --> 00:53:11,792
We've a great deal of work to do
tomorrow. Say good night to the ladies.

722
00:53:11,882 --> 00:53:15,631
- Good night, Isabelle. Amelie.
- Your room is here, Paul.

723
00:53:16,012 --> 00:53:19,594
It's my room. I hope you won't mind
my things being in there.

724
00:53:19,974 --> 00:53:21,765
They'll make it that much
more pleasant.

725
00:53:21,851 --> 00:53:23,262
Good night, Paul.

726
00:53:23,436 --> 00:53:25,843
- You, take his luggage.
- Me?

727
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:28,815
- No. Not you. You!
- Albert!

728
00:53:31,235 --> 00:53:32,398
Sorry.

729
00:53:33,279 --> 00:53:36,399
- This is your room, Cousin Andre.
- Are there any bugs?

730
00:53:36,741 --> 00:53:39,113
It was our room, Felix and mine.

731
00:53:39,201 --> 00:53:42,072
Well, perhaps it's all right.
Good night, Amelie.

732
00:53:42,163 --> 00:53:44,570
- Good night.
- Good night, Isabelle.

733
00:53:46,542 --> 00:53:48,202
What are you staring at?

734
00:53:48,294 --> 00:53:50,999
You. I've never seen
anything like you before.

735
00:53:51,130 --> 00:53:53,502
I have, but not on Christmas.

736
00:54:01,682 --> 00:54:03,889
Your servants are not too well-trained.

737
00:54:03,976 --> 00:54:07,844
But then, discipline never was
one of your virtues, Felix.

738
00:54:07,939 --> 00:54:10,856
And speaking of discipline...

739
00:54:11,692 --> 00:54:15,275
I intend to have certain things
understood from the start.

740
00:54:15,863 --> 00:54:19,197
No nonsense between
Isabelle and Paul. Is that clear?

741
00:54:19,492 --> 00:54:21,568
But she's been so anxious
to see him again.

742
00:54:21,661 --> 00:54:23,404
They were fond of each other
back home.

743
00:54:23,496 --> 00:54:27,196
If Isabelle is entertaining the idea of
marrying Paul because of my money...

744
00:54:27,291 --> 00:54:29,699
she can get rid
of her little scheme immediately.

745
00:54:29,794 --> 00:54:33,459
<i>Besides, Paul is already engaged
to the daughter of Monsieur Audibert...</i>

746
00:54:33,547 --> 00:54:37,166
the shipbuilder, a very rich man.
I need his ships for my...

747
00:54:40,054 --> 00:54:41,679
What do you want?

748
00:54:41,806 --> 00:54:45,554
All I want is to take care of you myself,
personally.

749
00:54:46,769 --> 00:54:49,225
He means,
perhaps you want something to eat...

750
00:54:49,313 --> 00:54:51,769
some turkey, maybe.
We had it for dinner.

751
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:56,100
I congratulate you.
Business must be better than I thought.

752
00:54:56,362 --> 00:54:58,651
- Well...
- Turkey's cheap here.

753
00:55:00,074 --> 00:55:03,573
When I want such little nuggets
of information, I'll ask you.

754
00:55:03,661 --> 00:55:05,120
Get me some fruit.

755
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:10,825
Yes, sir. Absolutely, sir.
I'll have it ready by morning.

756
00:55:14,589 --> 00:55:16,047
Uncouth lout!

757
00:55:21,929 --> 00:55:23,507
After you, lout.

758
00:55:24,890 --> 00:55:28,674
I've sent Paul to bed so that we could
get things straight without delay.

759
00:55:28,769 --> 00:55:31,095
I made everything clear, I hope,
in my letter...

760
00:55:31,188 --> 00:55:34,889
but there are certain points I want to be
reassured upon before I go to bed.

761
00:55:34,984 --> 00:55:37,605
I'm not here on a pleasure trip.
You understand that?

762
00:55:37,695 --> 00:55:40,696
I'm here because of
your confused and irregular reports...

763
00:55:40,781 --> 00:55:43,569
and I don't want to be bothered
with any idle chatter.

764
00:55:43,659 --> 00:55:46,993
- Your fruit, sir.
- Knife, fork. How do I eat it?

765
00:55:47,288 --> 00:55:48,996
You eat it like an apple.

766
00:55:51,542 --> 00:55:53,998
I want to know
how the business is going.

767
00:56:07,475 --> 00:56:09,633
And I want to know why,
in almost a year...

768
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:11,803
there isn't even a small margin of profit.

769
00:56:11,896 --> 00:56:14,138
Every report underlined in red ink.

770
00:56:24,492 --> 00:56:26,817
I spent this year getting used to things.

771
00:56:26,911 --> 00:56:30,778
By getting used to things, I suppose you
mean letting everything go to the devil.

772
00:56:30,873 --> 00:56:32,913
What were the gross receipts
for last month?

773
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,037
Last month?
I don't think they've been totalled yet.

774
00:56:36,504 --> 00:56:38,496
Last month was November.

775
00:56:38,839 --> 00:56:40,666
This is nearly the end of December...

776
00:56:40,758 --> 00:56:42,916
and you haven't closed the books
for November yet?

777
00:56:43,010 --> 00:56:44,718
Of course we have, sir.

778
00:56:45,179 --> 00:56:49,343
In November, we took in 32,815 francs.

779
00:56:49,433 --> 00:56:50,714
You did?

780
00:56:51,018 --> 00:56:53,141
- We did?
- We did.

781
00:56:53,229 --> 00:56:55,518
Thus far in December, we've taken in...

782
00:56:55,606 --> 00:56:59,604
33,824 francs and 12 centimes.

783
00:56:59,694 --> 00:57:03,110
That's only a rough estimate, of course.
The Christmas rush, you know.

784
00:57:03,197 --> 00:57:04,312
Yes.

785
00:57:04,407 --> 00:57:08,025
- Are you sure of the total for December?
- Am I sure?

786
00:57:11,956 --> 00:57:16,867
January, February, March,
April, May, June, July...

787
00:57:17,545 --> 00:57:19,668
That's a bad month. Rain, you know.

788
00:57:19,755 --> 00:57:23,255
August, September, October,
November, December.

789
00:57:23,467 --> 00:57:27,714
Here we are.
33,824 francs, 12 centimes...

790
00:57:27,930 --> 00:57:29,175
exactly.

791
00:57:30,725 --> 00:57:33,050
But how much of that was credit?

792
00:57:33,769 --> 00:57:34,884
Credit?

793
00:57:35,563 --> 00:57:39,608
Mr. Ducotel says to give credit
is exactly the same as giving a present.

794
00:57:40,318 --> 00:57:41,563
You did?

795
00:57:45,072 --> 00:57:48,572
Maybe I've misjudged you. I'll know
tomorrow when we take inventory.

796
00:57:48,659 --> 00:57:50,866
Tomorrow? We're not going
to work on Christmas Day?

797
00:57:50,953 --> 00:57:52,780
That way, we won't be disturbed.

798
00:57:52,872 --> 00:57:55,742
I don't intend to spend
the rest of my life here, you know.

799
00:57:55,833 --> 00:57:56,912
But I...

800
00:57:57,001 --> 00:57:59,492
I said tomorrow. Now, good night, Felix.

801
00:58:04,717 --> 00:58:06,176
Good evening.

802
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:14,260
- Have you gone crazy?
- Me?

803
00:58:14,352 --> 00:58:17,139
You know what I mean.
All that business about our receipts.

804
00:58:17,230 --> 00:58:18,688
Tomorrow, when he sees the books...

805
00:58:18,773 --> 00:58:21,478
The books? Oh, the books.

806
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:24,767
You're worried about the books.

807
00:58:24,862 --> 00:58:27,270
Gentlemen, he's worried
about the books.

808
00:58:34,288 --> 00:58:38,120
The books are in the safe,
and I won't give you the combination.

809
00:58:39,710 --> 00:58:43,210
He won't give us
the combination. Maestro.

810
00:59:13,035 --> 00:59:16,451
- What do you want with my books?
- We have all night to fix them up.

811
00:59:16,539 --> 00:59:18,330
It will take more than
one night to do that.

812
00:59:18,416 --> 00:59:20,823
Took me only one night
to fix up the books of a company...

813
00:59:20,918 --> 00:59:22,994
that was supposed to have
seven factories.

814
00:59:23,087 --> 00:59:27,085
- How many factories were there?
- No factories. Just stockholders.

815
00:59:29,135 --> 00:59:31,460
Watch the door. I don't trust him.

816
00:59:35,349 --> 00:59:37,009
What are you going to do?

817
00:59:37,101 --> 00:59:39,058
He's the Michelangelo
of French Guiana.

818
00:59:39,145 --> 00:59:41,433
I'm going to make you
the most successful businessman...

819
00:59:41,522 --> 00:59:43,016
on Devil's Island.

820
00:59:43,107 --> 00:59:45,016
No. Absolutely not.

821
00:59:45,318 --> 00:59:48,022
Doing your books
will be a real treat for me.

822
00:59:48,112 --> 00:59:50,188
You see, in business,
as in everything else...

823
00:59:50,281 --> 00:59:52,819
there is appearance,
and there is reality.

824
00:59:53,284 --> 00:59:54,743
But I'm an honest man.

825
00:59:54,827 --> 00:59:58,030
Of course you are.
That is reality. You are an honest man.

826
00:59:58,122 --> 01:00:01,040
What's the good of that if your books
make you look like a crook?

827
01:00:01,125 --> 01:00:04,708
All I'm going to do is make your books
agree with your character.

828
01:00:04,795 --> 01:00:08,627
An entry here, decimal point there,
an erasure or two...

829
01:00:08,758 --> 01:00:13,467
and soon you'll have taken in
33,824 francs in December...

830
01:00:14,722 --> 01:00:16,347
and 12 centimes.

831
01:00:23,147 --> 01:00:26,148
- Out of my way, you lout.
- You frighten me.

832
01:00:26,901 --> 01:00:28,443
Did you want something, Cousin Andre?

833
01:00:28,527 --> 01:00:31,232
I wanted to remind you that I rise early,
7:00 sharp.

834
01:00:31,322 --> 01:00:34,193
- I'll remember to call you.
- Be certain of it.

835
01:00:34,617 --> 01:00:36,325
Yes. One thing more.

836
01:00:37,662 --> 01:00:41,410
Your books. I'd like to have
a look at them before I go to sleep.

837
01:00:41,791 --> 01:00:44,329
- My books?
- Your accounts.

838
01:00:46,212 --> 01:00:47,291
These.

839
01:00:47,380 --> 01:00:49,918
I was just going to bring them
up to date.

840
01:00:50,174 --> 01:00:53,009
I'll take them just as they are,
pure and innocent.

841
01:00:53,094 --> 01:00:56,260
- But I haven't added in today's receipts.
- That's true.

842
01:00:56,931 --> 01:00:59,552
We'll do it tomorrow,
when I take inventory.

843
01:01:05,773 --> 01:01:08,940
Never mind. You're still a great artist.

844
01:01:09,986 --> 01:01:12,773
What good is it to be an artist
if you have nothing to paint with?

845
01:01:12,863 --> 01:01:16,861
- I'm relieved. I'm even happy.
- Why?

846
01:01:17,368 --> 01:01:19,824
Well, I was tempted. I admit it.

847
01:01:20,162 --> 01:01:24,291
I might have let you fix the books,
and I know I would have regretted it.

848
01:01:24,375 --> 01:01:27,709
I'm an honest man. That's my way.
What else can I do?

849
01:01:28,629 --> 01:01:31,120
I don't know. I never tried your way.

850
01:01:31,632 --> 01:01:35,381
Well, I'm going to bed now,
and I hope to sleep well.

851
01:01:35,469 --> 01:01:36,798
Good night, gentlemen.

852
01:01:36,887 --> 01:01:39,295
Good night.

853
01:01:44,896 --> 01:01:47,813
You've got to admire him,
even if you don't.

854
01:01:48,316 --> 01:01:50,225
We haven't helped him much.

855
01:01:53,654 --> 01:01:56,739
We ought to start thinking of ourselves.
We've been noble long enough.

856
01:01:56,824 --> 01:01:58,817
Yeah, if we're going to escape,
let's escape.

857
01:01:58,910 --> 01:02:00,819
There's nothing we can do for him.

858
01:02:00,912 --> 01:02:03,996
- There's still the girl and Paul.
- I don't like him.

859
01:02:04,498 --> 01:02:06,242
- You like her.
- Yeah.

860
01:02:07,084 --> 01:02:09,622
Then we'll fix things up for her
and then leave.

861
01:02:09,712 --> 01:02:12,666
Well, I don't know whether we'd be
doing her a good turn or not.

862
01:02:12,757 --> 01:02:15,426
She wants him,
and that's enough for me.

863
01:02:16,093 --> 01:02:17,256
What's this?

864
01:02:18,012 --> 01:02:21,760
"Dear Isabelle, I need you. I want you.

865
01:02:22,308 --> 01:02:24,347
"Come" what? "Come..."

866
01:02:25,394 --> 01:02:29,392
"Come to me, my adorable, my love."

867
01:02:30,524 --> 01:02:33,644
- Signed "Paul"?
- Signed "Paul."

868
01:02:34,487 --> 01:02:36,610
What if she knows his handwriting?

869
01:02:36,739 --> 01:02:38,399
If you got a beautiful note like this...

870
01:02:38,491 --> 01:02:40,649
would you waste time
comparing signatures?

871
01:02:40,743 --> 01:02:42,783
No. It would have to be signed
by a girl, though.

872
01:02:42,870 --> 01:02:45,871
The family's sleeping over at the stable.
Wake her up and give her this.

873
01:02:45,957 --> 01:02:48,911
Be sure you get the right bedroom,
and be sure that's all you get.

874
01:02:49,001 --> 01:02:50,033
What about him?

875
01:02:50,127 --> 01:02:53,331
Tell her to meet him in
the summerhouse. He'll be there.

876
01:02:55,675 --> 01:02:56,873
Locked.

877
01:03:16,404 --> 01:03:18,064
What do you want?

878
01:03:18,322 --> 01:03:20,149
We want to talk to you.

879
01:03:20,658 --> 01:03:22,781
Where do you buy those hats?

880
01:03:23,244 --> 01:03:25,486
You know, this isn't gonna be easy.

881
01:03:27,081 --> 01:03:29,916
- Where is he?
- Wait a minute.

882
01:03:30,585 --> 01:03:33,704
When a guy sends you a note like that,
you don't run.

883
01:03:33,796 --> 01:03:37,130
- But he might change his mind.
- If he does, you change it back.

884
01:03:37,216 --> 01:03:38,461
How could I do that?

885
01:03:38,551 --> 01:03:41,836
Paul will be in the summerhouse.
It's a nice, warm night.

886
01:03:41,929 --> 01:03:46,591
Just do a little of this, a little of that,
and you're in business.

887
01:03:47,101 --> 01:03:49,592
- You got any perfume?
- Yes.

888
01:03:49,854 --> 01:03:51,134
Pour it on.

889
01:03:52,189 --> 01:03:54,941
That bathrobe.
You afraid of catching cold?

890
01:03:55,026 --> 01:03:57,232
What's the matter with my bathrobe?

891
01:03:57,695 --> 01:04:00,779
Well, to begin with,
you can't see through it.

892
01:04:03,993 --> 01:04:05,701
You're getting the idea.

893
01:04:11,959 --> 01:04:14,248
- Like that?
- That'll do the trick.

894
01:04:15,212 --> 01:04:18,795
Albert, where did you ever learn
so much about... So much?

895
01:04:19,300 --> 01:04:21,458
I read a lot of books.

896
01:04:28,851 --> 01:04:30,891
It's an absolute outrage!

897
01:04:30,978 --> 01:04:33,137
Just because we ask you to meet
a sweet young thing...

898
01:04:33,231 --> 01:04:34,808
on a beautiful tropical night?

899
01:04:34,899 --> 01:04:37,354
- You got a loose bolt somewhere.
- I'm not in love with her.

900
01:04:37,443 --> 01:04:39,436
You're not going to tell her that,
are you?

901
01:04:39,528 --> 01:04:41,817
- No.
- He's not as stupid as he looks.

902
01:04:41,906 --> 01:04:44,658
- What'll I say?
- Let her do the talking.

903
01:04:44,742 --> 01:04:47,992
Say "yes, darling" once in a while
and nod your head the rest of the time.

904
01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:50,349
- That's the way to make love.
- What if she stops talking?

905
01:04:50,373 --> 01:04:52,780
- Kiss her. It's customary.
- But I don't want to kiss her.

906
01:04:52,875 --> 01:04:55,746
You will.
At your age, it won't take long either.

907
01:04:55,836 --> 01:04:57,794
You realise this isn't going to work,
don't you?

908
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:00,715
Uncle Andre will hear about this
in the morning.

909
01:05:00,841 --> 01:05:02,217
Who's that?

910
01:05:11,686 --> 01:05:13,014
It's you!

911
01:05:14,564 --> 01:05:16,521
How could I be anybody else?

912
01:05:16,607 --> 01:05:18,849
I'm looking for Isabelle.
She's gone from her room.

913
01:05:18,943 --> 01:05:20,022
Don't worry about it.

914
01:05:20,111 --> 01:05:22,269
Paul's not here either.
She's not with him, is she?

915
01:05:22,363 --> 01:05:25,862
Yes. But they're well-chaperoned.
My friends are there.

916
01:05:25,950 --> 01:05:28,441
But he's not the right man for her.

917
01:05:33,291 --> 01:05:36,909
He's not the right man for anybody,
but she's got to find that out for herself.

918
01:05:37,003 --> 01:05:39,672
She'll ask him a lot of questions,
and he won't want to answer.

919
01:05:39,755 --> 01:05:43,255
If he's no good, and I think
he's no good, she'll find it out.

920
01:05:43,342 --> 01:05:46,545
- Give her a chance.
- You know everything, don't you?

921
01:05:47,930 --> 01:05:50,504
Experience. A long time ago.

922
01:05:51,684 --> 01:05:54,305
- You're quite a salesman.
- Thank you.

923
01:05:55,521 --> 01:05:56,684
You know...

924
01:05:57,189 --> 01:05:59,348
I owe you and your friends an apology.

925
01:05:59,442 --> 01:06:02,015
I thought you were like
the other convicts.

926
01:06:03,279 --> 01:06:05,687
I thought you came here to rob us.

927
01:06:06,073 --> 01:06:08,196
Whatever gave you that idea?

928
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:14,244
Well, I was wrong. I see that now.
You like us, don't you?

929
01:06:16,542 --> 01:06:20,326
And I envy you and Felix.
You're a nice family.

930
01:06:21,464 --> 01:06:23,373
A good home and a fine store.

931
01:06:24,467 --> 01:06:27,587
- I'll fix the bell over the door tomorrow.
- Thank you.

932
01:06:27,678 --> 01:06:29,137
Not that way.

933
01:06:31,182 --> 01:06:35,345
- We'll see that they don't get any ideas.
- Thank you again for everything.

934
01:06:35,561 --> 01:06:37,221
Good night.

935
01:06:48,241 --> 01:06:51,740
All this year I've remembered you
and what we said to each other.

936
01:06:51,827 --> 01:06:53,903
- Has he kissed her yet?
- No.

937
01:06:54,247 --> 01:06:56,239
He's waiting to be bribed.

938
01:06:58,125 --> 01:07:02,075
Now we're together,
with only the future before us.

939
01:07:03,547 --> 01:07:06,217
Uncle Andre has plans for my future.

940
01:07:06,842 --> 01:07:10,211
You can earn a living without his help,
right here.

941
01:07:10,888 --> 01:07:14,589
Why, in a lumber mill or on a plantation.

942
01:07:15,101 --> 01:07:19,015
- I'm not much good at drawing things.
- You wouldn't have to be.

943
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:22,600
In the morning you could ride up
on a horse and give orders...

944
01:07:22,692 --> 01:07:25,811
and then come home to me and
I'd put my arms around you like this...

945
01:07:25,903 --> 01:07:28,857
and we'd never stop making love
to each other.

946
01:07:28,990 --> 01:07:32,489
- What do you say to that?
- I don't know how to ride a horse.

947
01:07:34,829 --> 01:07:36,868
What has become of France?

948
01:07:41,711 --> 01:07:44,462
If only you knew
how often I've dreamt of this.

949
01:07:46,799 --> 01:07:50,631
I wonder what Cousin Andre will say
when you tell him we're in love.

950
01:07:50,803 --> 01:07:53,804
- Do you think I should tell him?
- It would be easy.

951
01:07:54,015 --> 01:07:56,470
You just go up to him and say:

952
01:07:56,976 --> 01:08:01,437
"I love Isabelle, and that for you."
Go ahead and try it.

953
01:08:01,898 --> 01:08:04,223
- "I love Isabelle."
- I love Isabelle.

954
01:08:04,442 --> 01:08:06,648
"And that for you."

955
01:08:08,279 --> 01:08:10,604
- And that for you.
- See?

956
01:08:11,032 --> 01:08:12,194
Bravo!

957
01:08:14,493 --> 01:08:15,822
Uncle Andre.

958
01:08:16,412 --> 01:08:17,823
Go to your room at once.

959
01:08:17,914 --> 01:08:19,823
- But, Uncle Andre, I...
- You heard me.

960
01:08:19,916 --> 01:08:22,122
Tell him, Paul. It's our only chance.

961
01:08:22,209 --> 01:08:24,783
- Uncle Andre, I...
- I said, go to your room.

962
01:08:25,630 --> 01:08:28,037
Here, take these with you
and study them.

963
01:08:28,132 --> 01:08:30,290
I want to discuss them with you later.

964
01:08:30,384 --> 01:08:31,464
Paul.

965
01:08:32,553 --> 01:08:33,882
I'm sorry.

966
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:36,887
I think it's better this way.

967
01:08:38,267 --> 01:08:40,426
Now you listen to me, young woman.

968
01:08:40,978 --> 01:08:43,018
You are not to flirt with Paul.
I forbid it.

969
01:08:43,105 --> 01:08:45,561
If you think you are going to get him
along with my fortune...

970
01:08:45,650 --> 01:08:47,690
- you are sadly mistaken.
- I don't want your money.

971
01:08:47,777 --> 01:08:51,193
Nonsense. Everyone wants my money.
Paul, most of all.

972
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:53,189
- That's not true.
- Don't be a little fool.

973
01:08:53,282 --> 01:08:55,571
He can't wait for me to die
to get my millions.

974
01:08:55,660 --> 01:08:59,029
And that's the way it should be.
I was the same at his age.

975
01:08:59,121 --> 01:09:02,039
If that were true, I wouldn't love Paul,
I'd hate him.

976
01:09:02,124 --> 01:09:05,825
You make everything seem wicked
because that's the way you are yourself.

977
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:08,245
Your opinion of me has no cash value.

978
01:09:08,589 --> 01:09:09,870
Incidentally...

979
01:09:10,549 --> 01:09:13,219
I've been going over your father's books,
and it may well be...

980
01:09:13,302 --> 01:09:16,885
that he will remain on Devil's Island
as something other than a civilian.

981
01:09:16,973 --> 01:09:19,298
Good night, my dear. Pleasant dreams.

982
01:09:21,561 --> 01:09:24,182
What are you men doing here?
Out of my way!

983
01:09:24,272 --> 01:09:27,107
- Shut up.
- That's much better than being polite.

984
01:09:27,650 --> 01:09:31,268
You'd better get to bed.
Nobody's getting any sleep around here.

985
01:09:37,076 --> 01:09:38,784
This is outrageous!

986
01:09:39,078 --> 01:09:41,201
What's the matter?
You a little nervous, maybe?

987
01:09:41,289 --> 01:09:45,121
I'm sorry. Is this what you're looking for?
I've cleaned it for you.

988
01:09:45,251 --> 01:09:46,579
Now things are different!

989
01:09:46,669 --> 01:09:50,501
No, not much, I'm afraid, because
you see, I had to clean the bullets, too.

990
01:09:50,590 --> 01:09:53,923
- I'll have you all arrested!
- It's a little late for that.

991
01:09:54,302 --> 01:09:57,753
- That was taken care of some time ago.
- Permanently.

992
01:10:00,016 --> 01:10:02,139
- You murderers.
- You said it.

993
01:10:02,393 --> 01:10:04,136
Not me. I'm a maniac.

994
01:10:04,437 --> 01:10:06,643
I'm acquainted with the law here.

995
01:10:06,731 --> 01:10:10,598
You're on parole. Tomorrow I'll see
the Governor. He'll hear about this.

996
01:10:10,693 --> 01:10:13,398
I'll see to it that he gives you
a Christmas you won't forget...

997
01:10:13,487 --> 01:10:14,863
five years in solitary!

998
01:10:14,947 --> 01:10:18,114
- How's that for a Christmas present?
- That's a lovely Christmas present.

999
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:20,407
But how're you going to wrap it up?

1000
01:10:22,371 --> 01:10:25,705
Uncle Andre! I've been going over this.
It's simply incredible.

1001
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:27,618
You better have a look at it.

1002
01:10:27,710 --> 01:10:29,204
I'll deal with you in the morning.

1003
01:10:29,295 --> 01:10:32,960
You're not very polite. I don't think
I want to take inventory with you.

1004
01:10:33,049 --> 01:10:34,958
Don't worry. You won't.

1005
01:10:36,928 --> 01:10:39,419
I've an idea we'll discover
that Felix and these thieves...

1006
01:10:39,513 --> 01:10:43,096
have been robbing us blind.
Come on, Paul. We'll soon find out.

1007
01:10:48,231 --> 01:10:50,804
They shouldn't let crooks like that
on Devil's Island.

1008
01:10:50,900 --> 01:10:53,106
No. It'll give the place a bad name.

1009
01:10:53,194 --> 01:10:57,322
He's lived too long, that's his trouble.
Much too long.

1010
01:10:58,866 --> 01:11:00,610
Get what's on my mind?

1011
01:11:07,083 --> 01:11:09,075
Do you get what's on his mind?

1012
01:11:14,173 --> 01:11:15,584
Oh, that.

1013
01:11:18,094 --> 01:11:20,217
I insist that everything be legal.

1014
01:11:20,638 --> 01:11:23,390
Okay. We'll give him a legal-type trial.

1015
01:11:24,892 --> 01:11:26,470
That's a good idea.

1016
01:11:29,522 --> 01:11:33,021
Court is now in session.
Albert, you're the prosecuting attorney.

1017
01:11:33,109 --> 01:11:36,774
You are the attorney for the defence.
The trial will proceed.

1018
01:11:37,029 --> 01:11:40,030
Your Honour, gentlemen of the jury...

1019
01:11:41,367 --> 01:11:43,739
I demand a verdict of "guilty."

1020
01:11:44,912 --> 01:11:49,788
If you don't give me a verdict of "guilty,"
I'll get a new jury.

1021
01:11:50,876 --> 01:11:53,368
If there are any objections,
they're overruled.

1022
01:11:53,462 --> 01:11:55,669
The court now recognises...

1023
01:11:55,756 --> 01:11:58,757
the distinguished attorney
for the defence.

1024
01:12:01,345 --> 01:12:02,804
Your Honour...

1025
01:12:03,723 --> 01:12:07,056
gentlemen of the jury.

1026
01:12:08,895 --> 01:12:10,389
The defence...

1027
01:12:16,694 --> 01:12:17,857
rests.

1028
01:12:18,905 --> 01:12:20,814
How's that for the defence?

1029
01:12:20,907 --> 01:12:22,780
Reminds me of my lawyer.

1030
01:12:23,326 --> 01:12:26,529
Gentlemen of the jury,
have you reached a verdict?

1031
01:12:26,621 --> 01:12:28,412
The verdict is death.

1032
01:12:29,081 --> 01:12:31,489
Has the defendant anything to say?

1033
01:12:31,667 --> 01:12:32,987
The defendant has nothing to say.

1034
01:12:33,044 --> 01:12:34,964
- I insist that the case be appealed.
- Rejected.

1035
01:12:35,004 --> 01:12:36,913
- Sustained.
- Counsel, you're out of order.

1036
01:12:37,006 --> 01:12:39,544
Your Honour, is this trial going
to drag on forever?

1037
01:12:39,634 --> 01:12:40,914
On a point of order...

1038
01:12:41,010 --> 01:12:44,177
my client realises the hopelessness
of his position.

1039
01:12:44,263 --> 01:12:48,261
He realises that he must be executed.
The question is how?

1040
01:12:49,268 --> 01:12:50,347
How?

1041
01:12:52,772 --> 01:12:56,437
We'll escape. I'll go to Paris and
get a job in his company.

1042
01:12:56,651 --> 01:13:00,102
At the end of the year, he'll be bankrupt
and blow his brains out.

1043
01:13:00,196 --> 01:13:03,280
The idea has some merit,
but why must we wait that long?

1044
01:13:03,366 --> 01:13:05,773
- Can't we do it quicker?
- This is quicker.

1045
01:13:05,868 --> 01:13:07,243
Adolphe. Of course.

1046
01:13:07,328 --> 01:13:09,155
We'll wrap him up
like a Christmas present...

1047
01:13:09,247 --> 01:13:10,954
give him to cousin Andre.
Merry Christmas.

1048
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:15,038
We'll just pop it into his bed.
Our friends are minus a nasty relative.

1049
01:13:16,337 --> 01:13:17,748
Court's adjourned.

1050
01:13:18,172 --> 01:13:21,623
There's a fortune to be made
raising these little creatures.

1051
01:13:35,147 --> 01:13:38,647
Well, what's it going to be?
"Merry Christmas" or "surprise"?

1052
01:13:40,444 --> 01:13:43,018
I just thought of something.
We can't do it.

1053
01:13:43,739 --> 01:13:45,981
You worried about Adolphe?
It won't hurt him a bit.

1054
01:13:46,075 --> 01:13:48,447
I'm worried about the family.
What would it look like...

1055
01:13:48,536 --> 01:13:50,908
if Cousin Andre turns up
in the morning a corpse?

1056
01:13:50,997 --> 01:13:54,448
- Who cares what the neighbours say?
- I'm thinking of the girl and her mother.

1057
01:13:54,542 --> 01:13:57,993
Cousin Andre's found dead in bed
a terrible shade of green.

1058
01:13:58,337 --> 01:14:01,671
They come to us and they say,
"Did you do this?"

1059
01:14:02,383 --> 01:14:06,001
Which one of us can look them
in the eye and lie about it?

1060
01:14:15,563 --> 01:14:20,308
I'm in a nest of thieves.
Nice bookkeeping. Look at this!

1061
01:14:21,903 --> 01:14:25,272
Fourteen watches missing from stock.
Three harmonicas.

1062
01:14:25,364 --> 01:14:27,653
A 410-piece set of dishware.

1063
01:14:28,451 --> 01:14:30,075
There must be crooks on this island.

1064
01:14:30,161 --> 01:14:32,866
Yes, and the biggest crooks
are right here.

1065
01:14:34,332 --> 01:14:35,494
What's this?

1066
01:14:37,001 --> 01:14:39,373
Something else stolen from stock,
I suppose.

1067
01:14:39,462 --> 01:14:43,127
- It's mine.
- Don't tell me that! I know better.

1068
01:14:43,799 --> 01:14:48,093
You convicts aren't allowed to have
personal possessions. What's inside it?

1069
01:14:49,305 --> 01:14:53,053
- A snake.
- Don't lie to me. How do you open it?

1070
01:14:54,769 --> 01:14:56,726
I said, how do you open it?

1071
01:14:57,730 --> 01:14:59,308
Why don't I tell him?

1072
01:15:01,984 --> 01:15:03,015
No.

1073
01:15:05,655 --> 01:15:08,609
It's his personal property.
Give it back to him.

1074
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:13,909
Not till I know what's inside. You're
not going to steal this if I can help it.

1075
01:15:38,938 --> 01:15:41,559
Someone ought to rush in
and warn him.

1076
01:15:44,443 --> 01:15:47,563
Jules, you rush in and tell him...

1077
01:15:48,489 --> 01:15:51,241
before it's too late.
Tell him there's a snake in that box.

1078
01:15:51,325 --> 01:15:54,908
He won't believe me.
He doesn't like me.

1079
01:15:55,830 --> 01:15:58,451
- Albert.
- Were you talking to me?

1080
01:15:59,208 --> 01:16:01,450
You ought to run and warn him.

1081
01:16:01,627 --> 01:16:03,584
Why don't we cut cards for it?

1082
01:16:04,130 --> 01:16:07,131
Good idea. I'll get the cards.

1083
01:16:24,317 --> 01:16:25,811
Who cuts first?

1084
01:16:26,235 --> 01:16:28,726
I hate being first. Bad luck.

1085
01:16:29,697 --> 01:16:32,900
- After you.
- You chaps are bum sports.

1086
01:16:48,841 --> 01:16:50,383
It's up to you.

1087
01:16:51,636 --> 01:16:53,509
I'll run and tell him.

1088
01:17:08,277 --> 01:17:10,947
I forgot what I was supposed to tell him.

1089
01:17:11,530 --> 01:17:15,362
Tell him that he should
on no account try to open that cage.

1090
01:17:16,244 --> 01:17:19,447
Tell him, because if he does try to...

1091
01:17:19,538 --> 01:17:23,204
and puts his hand inside the cage...

1092
01:17:23,292 --> 01:17:25,368
to find out what's there...

1093
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:28,956
he's liable to be disagreeably surprised.

1094
01:17:32,051 --> 01:17:33,462
Tell him...

1095
01:17:33,636 --> 01:17:35,878
Well, that there's a deadly...

1096
01:17:37,056 --> 01:17:39,179
and poisonous snake...

1097
01:17:40,142 --> 01:17:42,847
inside of the cage.

1098
01:17:44,730 --> 01:17:45,975
Tell him.

1099
01:18:08,045 --> 01:18:09,789
You didn't tell him.

1100
01:18:12,049 --> 01:18:13,674
He knows already.

1101
01:18:27,106 --> 01:18:28,517
Good morning.

1102
01:18:31,527 --> 01:18:33,271
How's it turned out?

1103
01:18:33,362 --> 01:18:36,447
Cousin Andre himself
couldn't tell the difference.

1104
01:18:36,532 --> 01:18:38,691
That's his writing. This is mine.

1105
01:18:41,454 --> 01:18:42,699
Perfection.

1106
01:18:43,789 --> 01:18:47,289
"I, Andre Trochard,
being of sound mind and body...

1107
01:18:49,670 --> 01:18:54,213
"do hereby declare this is
my last will and testament," et cetera.

1108
01:18:54,383 --> 01:18:57,135
Yes, well, there's no point in allowing
the old man to die...

1109
01:18:57,219 --> 01:18:58,500
with his estate all muddled.

1110
01:18:58,596 --> 01:19:01,087
I left everything to Paul and Felix,
to be equally divided.

1111
01:19:01,182 --> 01:19:04,099
- You're very generous.
- Easy come, easy go.

1112
01:19:04,435 --> 01:19:07,555
Put this in the briefcase
and leave it in plain sight.

1113
01:19:26,082 --> 01:19:29,248
- How's our client this morning?
- Still dead.

1114
01:19:29,835 --> 01:19:34,047
That's the way it is, "In the midst of
life," et cetera, I forget the rest of it.

1115
01:19:34,131 --> 01:19:36,836
- I hope he looks all right.
- Looks fine.

1116
01:19:36,926 --> 01:19:38,206
I think he looks better.

1117
01:19:38,302 --> 01:19:40,924
Yes, he was too pale
when he was alive.

1118
01:19:41,097 --> 01:19:43,932
Well, this has all been very enjoyable.

1119
01:19:44,267 --> 01:19:46,343
We ought to start thinking
of getting out of here.

1120
01:19:46,435 --> 01:19:48,843
That ship in the harbour
isn't going to stay there forever.

1121
01:19:48,938 --> 01:19:51,096
We can't leave the place
looking so untidy.

1122
01:19:51,190 --> 01:19:55,402
First somebody has to find the body
and the will.

1123
01:19:56,487 --> 01:19:58,361
Then we shove off.

1124
01:19:58,447 --> 01:20:01,117
First somebody has to find the body.

1125
01:20:01,284 --> 01:20:04,368
- I'd be glad to.
- I'm always prepared to scream.

1126
01:20:04,787 --> 01:20:07,456
No. It should be an innocent bystander.

1127
01:20:07,540 --> 01:20:11,668
<i>Anybody here? It's me! Madame Parole!</i>

1128
01:20:11,752 --> 01:20:14,374
It's that delicious fat woman
from yesterday.

1129
01:20:15,131 --> 01:20:17,704
The ideal person to discover a corpse.

1130
01:20:19,093 --> 01:20:22,177
I'll see if I can
work the conversation around to it.

1131
01:20:22,555 --> 01:20:25,722
- We got to get Adolphe.
- Give him a strawberry from me.

1132
01:20:27,560 --> 01:20:28,888
Good morning.

1133
01:20:28,978 --> 01:20:32,062
- What may I do for you?
- I wish to complain to Mr. Ducotel.

1134
01:20:32,148 --> 01:20:33,891
- It's about this.
- What about it?

1135
01:20:33,983 --> 01:20:37,352
There's nothing in it but water.
I wish to complain.

1136
01:20:38,988 --> 01:20:42,191
By all means. I think you should.
This is serious.

1137
01:20:42,950 --> 01:20:45,441
Andre Trochard arrived last night,
the owner.

1138
01:20:45,536 --> 01:20:48,407
I suggest you complain
to him personally.

1139
01:20:48,497 --> 01:20:49,873
Bring him in here.

1140
01:20:49,957 --> 01:20:52,246
I'd rather not.
If you'd just step this way.

1141
01:20:52,335 --> 01:20:53,615
Where is he?

1142
01:20:54,086 --> 01:20:55,201
He's in bed at the moment.

1143
01:20:55,296 --> 01:20:58,463
I have no intention
of speaking to him till he gets up.

1144
01:20:58,799 --> 01:21:02,133
- That'll take a while.
- Well, then I'll call back later.

1145
01:21:02,345 --> 01:21:04,503
I have a great many things
to say to Mr. Trochard...

1146
01:21:04,597 --> 01:21:06,886
about the way this establishment is run.

1147
01:21:06,974 --> 01:21:09,596
Before you go, about your account.

1148
01:21:09,685 --> 01:21:12,603
Just a little payment on your bill
from that nice purse of yours?

1149
01:21:12,688 --> 01:21:14,764
I haven't any money with me.

1150
01:21:14,857 --> 01:21:17,858
You haven't looked.
We'll look together, shall we?

1151
01:21:17,944 --> 01:21:19,652
How dare you?

1152
01:21:19,946 --> 01:21:24,109
- If I'd had any idea I wasn't trusted here!
- Trust is the very heart of business.

1153
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:26,952
It's only due to a lack of trust
that I'm here on this island.

1154
01:21:27,036 --> 01:21:28,993
- Lack of trust?
- By others.

1155
01:21:29,789 --> 01:21:31,947
Don't forget this. You paid for it.

1156
01:21:41,133 --> 01:21:44,253
- We can't find Adolphe.
- We looked all over the place.

1157
01:21:45,388 --> 01:21:47,594
He's not a trinket to leave lying around.

1158
01:21:47,682 --> 01:21:50,801
Probably recuperating somewhere.
After all, he bit Trochard.

1159
01:21:50,893 --> 01:21:52,553
He'll die without an antidote.

1160
01:21:52,645 --> 01:21:56,477
A thing like that does take a lot
out of Adolphe. Poor little guy.

1161
01:21:56,566 --> 01:21:59,270
He's probably lying
in the corner someplace...

1162
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:01,483
coiled up like a pretty little bracelet.

1163
01:22:01,571 --> 01:22:04,441
We'd better find him
before somebody puts him on.

1164
01:22:18,963 --> 01:22:20,291
Adolphe.

1165
01:22:22,258 --> 01:22:25,175
Good morning.

1166
01:22:26,512 --> 01:22:27,971
What are you doing?

1167
01:22:29,974 --> 01:22:31,349
- Yeah...
- Yes.

1168
01:22:32,393 --> 01:22:34,516
- We've lost something.
- A little...

1169
01:22:34,604 --> 01:22:36,098
Yes, a...

1170
01:22:37,565 --> 01:22:38,976
- Bracelet.
- Yeah!

1171
01:22:39,066 --> 01:22:42,400
- About this big.
- I'll help you.

1172
01:22:42,486 --> 01:22:45,191
No, thanks! Anyway, it looks like
you're on your way out.

1173
01:22:45,281 --> 01:22:47,570
Yes, I was going to early mass.

1174
01:22:47,658 --> 01:22:50,232
But are you sure
you don't want me to help?

1175
01:22:53,372 --> 01:22:56,243
Why, yes.
There is something you can do.

1176
01:22:59,253 --> 01:23:02,705
Maybe Cousin Andre
would like to go to church.

1177
01:23:04,050 --> 01:23:05,841
You could ask him.

1178
01:23:05,927 --> 01:23:08,418
Why don't you go in there
and say, "How about church?"

1179
01:23:08,512 --> 01:23:11,217
I'm sure he's dying to go.

1180
01:23:11,933 --> 01:23:15,052
I don't want to talk to him,
not after last night.

1181
01:23:15,144 --> 01:23:18,180
After last night,
he needs church more than anybody.

1182
01:23:19,357 --> 01:23:20,767
Why don't you call him?

1183
01:23:20,858 --> 01:23:23,693
And have him shout at me again?
No, thank you.

1184
01:23:23,778 --> 01:23:25,687
But you never know.
He may have changed.

1185
01:23:25,780 --> 01:23:28,187
I wouldn't be surprised
if you found him much quieter today.

1186
01:23:28,282 --> 01:23:31,485
I hope so. I'll say a prayer for him.

1187
01:23:32,620 --> 01:23:34,280
Yes, he needs it.

1188
01:23:37,750 --> 01:23:39,743
I'll say a prayer for you, too.

1189
01:23:43,381 --> 01:23:45,172
Well, that's the way it goes.

1190
01:23:45,258 --> 01:23:49,089
When you've got a body you don't want
found, everyone falls over it.

1191
01:23:50,263 --> 01:23:53,632
We better find Adolphe
before somebody falls over him.

1192
01:23:53,724 --> 01:23:57,804
Maybe he went out the window into
the garden. He likes flowers, you know.

1193
01:24:20,418 --> 01:24:23,169
- What is it?
- Excuse me. We lost something.

1194
01:24:24,505 --> 01:24:26,913
- Up there?
- It isn't very heavy.

1195
01:24:28,259 --> 01:24:30,465
Morning. Glad to see you.

1196
01:24:31,387 --> 01:24:33,878
- Have a nice sleep?
- Fine, thank you.

1197
01:24:34,765 --> 01:24:38,051
- My cousin, is he up yet?
- No. He hasn't moved a muscle.

1198
01:24:41,647 --> 01:24:43,806
Don't you think
it's about time you called him?

1199
01:24:43,900 --> 01:24:47,814
No. Let him sleep.
When he wakes, my troubles begin.

1200
01:24:47,904 --> 01:24:50,395
A man his age
doesn't need so much sleep.

1201
01:24:51,324 --> 01:24:53,447
Why don't we all go in there
and surprise him?

1202
01:24:53,534 --> 01:24:56,488
I don't want to see him just now.

1203
01:24:56,579 --> 01:24:59,615
I'm going for a walk.
My wife is preparing breakfast.

1204
01:24:59,707 --> 01:25:02,708
If she calls me,
come and tell me at the cafe.

1205
01:25:04,211 --> 01:25:06,999
Cafe? I bet he's sneaking out
for a drink.

1206
01:25:07,089 --> 01:25:08,833
I could stand a drink myself.

1207
01:25:08,925 --> 01:25:10,964
Here we are with a dead body
lying about...

1208
01:25:11,052 --> 01:25:12,510
and we can't get anybody to find it.

1209
01:25:12,595 --> 01:25:16,379
I used to want to escape from jail.
Now I want to escape from here.

1210
01:25:16,849 --> 01:25:20,218
No, I'm not gonna leave Adolphe
behind. He's dangerous.

1211
01:25:20,937 --> 01:25:23,558
Search every inch of the living room.
You look in the store.

1212
01:25:23,648 --> 01:25:25,806
I'll make sure he isn't out here.

1213
01:25:33,449 --> 01:25:35,905
Adolphe. I know you're there.

1214
01:25:55,304 --> 01:25:57,261
What are you men doing?

1215
01:25:57,348 --> 01:25:59,139
Well, we're leaving soon...

1216
01:25:59,225 --> 01:26:02,226
and I thought
we'd better get our things together.

1217
01:26:02,895 --> 01:26:04,306
- May I?
- Thank you.

1218
01:26:05,231 --> 01:26:07,437
Don't you think you'd better get on
with your housework?

1219
01:26:07,525 --> 01:26:08,770
I'm getting breakfast ready.

1220
01:26:08,859 --> 01:26:11,433
I thought maybe you'd like
to start tidying up a little early.

1221
01:26:11,529 --> 01:26:16,072
Dusting, maybe.
Cousin Andre's room. Make the bed.

1222
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:18,074
That can wait a while.

1223
01:26:21,414 --> 01:26:23,987
I'd like to talk to you
if you can spare a few minutes.

1224
01:26:24,083 --> 01:26:27,250
A man sentenced to life
can always spare a few minutes.

1225
01:26:31,215 --> 01:26:32,959
I thought maybe it was damp.

1226
01:26:33,050 --> 01:26:35,422
Well, you're very considerate.

1227
01:26:35,511 --> 01:26:37,255
I try. I do try.

1228
01:26:38,639 --> 01:26:41,676
This might sound strange,
but I envy you.

1229
01:26:42,768 --> 01:26:45,438
- Me? A criminal?
- I wish I could be like you.

1230
01:26:46,647 --> 01:26:49,138
You're not thinking of
committing a crime?

1231
01:26:49,233 --> 01:26:50,858
I was last night.

1232
01:26:52,111 --> 01:26:53,689
I know you won't believe this...

1233
01:26:53,779 --> 01:26:57,231
but I was thinking of different ways
to kill Andre Trochard.

1234
01:26:59,660 --> 01:27:01,320
That's very funny.

1235
01:27:02,455 --> 01:27:04,613
I know it sounds ridiculous.

1236
01:27:07,585 --> 01:27:09,494
Yes and no.

1237
01:27:09,754 --> 01:27:11,545
That's as far as
it would ever go with me.

1238
01:27:11,631 --> 01:27:13,504
Just an idea in the back of my mind.

1239
01:27:13,591 --> 01:27:14,670
Wishful thinking.

1240
01:27:14,759 --> 01:27:17,878
While you're wishing,
don't give up hope.

1241
01:27:19,347 --> 01:27:20,592
Adolphe.

1242
01:27:22,224 --> 01:27:24,264
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1243
01:27:25,311 --> 01:27:28,312
- What are you doing down there?
- You're the one.

1244
01:27:28,397 --> 01:27:30,437
- What?
- To wake your uncle.

1245
01:27:30,983 --> 01:27:33,190
Good heavens. Isn't Uncle awake yet?

1246
01:27:33,527 --> 01:27:36,279
That's strange. He wanted to get up
early this morning.

1247
01:27:36,364 --> 01:27:37,692
Didn't you call him?

1248
01:27:37,782 --> 01:27:39,462
I knocked at the door, as he instructed...

1249
01:27:39,533 --> 01:27:41,906
but I didn't like to go in because...

1250
01:27:42,286 --> 01:27:45,323
I see. Very well. I'll call him.

1251
01:27:45,414 --> 01:27:47,656
I'm glad you said that. Excuse me.

1252
01:27:48,417 --> 01:27:50,125
<i>Monsieur Trochard?</i>

1253
01:27:57,260 --> 01:27:58,458
Tallyho!

1254
01:28:05,017 --> 01:28:06,761
<i>Albert. Eureka!</i>

1255
01:28:08,938 --> 01:28:11,180
- You find Adolphe?
- No.

1256
01:28:25,871 --> 01:28:28,030
My uncle. My uncle's dead!

1257
01:28:28,874 --> 01:28:31,544
What? It's impossible!

1258
01:28:34,839 --> 01:28:37,709
- He's dead, I tell you.
- Are you joking?

1259
01:28:40,052 --> 01:28:43,219
You mean dear Cousin Andre
is no longer among us?

1260
01:28:45,891 --> 01:28:49,675
And yet people say that a long
sea voyage is good for the health.

1261
01:28:49,770 --> 01:28:51,348
Yes, they do say that.

1262
01:28:51,439 --> 01:28:53,515
He didn't look well last night.

1263
01:28:53,608 --> 01:28:55,980
Well, he never looked really well.

1264
01:28:57,445 --> 01:28:59,687
You have our deepest sympathy.

1265
01:29:01,240 --> 01:29:04,407
Well, now to get on
with the funeral arrangements.

1266
01:29:04,785 --> 01:29:06,493
- I better get dressed.
- There's no hurry.

1267
01:29:06,579 --> 01:29:09,284
We can't in all decency
bury him before lunch.

1268
01:29:15,838 --> 01:29:18,543
This has been a terrible shock to them.

1269
01:29:22,470 --> 01:29:25,091
I can't believe it. Andre dead?

1270
01:29:25,723 --> 01:29:27,348
It happens to everybody.

1271
01:29:27,433 --> 01:29:28,785
Where's my husband? Where's Felix?

1272
01:29:28,809 --> 01:29:31,514
I'll take you to him.
It's the least I can do.

1273
01:30:01,300 --> 01:30:02,379
Yes?

1274
01:30:04,762 --> 01:30:06,968
That droopy look of yours
is very effective.

1275
01:30:07,056 --> 01:30:09,381
It'll look wonderful at the gravesite.

1276
01:30:09,475 --> 01:30:11,302
What are you doing
with my uncle's briefcase?

1277
01:30:11,394 --> 01:30:13,600
We thought you might like
to look through his papers.

1278
01:30:13,688 --> 01:30:16,605
We thought there might be a will in here
or something.

1279
01:30:16,691 --> 01:30:18,101
Leave me alone.

1280
01:30:18,192 --> 01:30:20,648
Can't you see how upset I am
about my poor uncle's death?

1281
01:30:20,736 --> 01:30:23,821
- I can hardly keep from laughing myself.
- Get out!

1282
01:30:25,199 --> 01:30:28,319
I say, I love that droopy look.
It's very effective.

1283
01:30:34,959 --> 01:30:38,494
- I'm so ashamed, wishing he were dead.
- No, you shouldn't be.

1284
01:30:38,588 --> 01:30:41,423
You committed the perfect crime.
It all took place up there.

1285
01:30:41,507 --> 01:30:45,968
No evidence, no witnesses, just results.
I envy you.

1286
01:30:46,053 --> 01:30:49,718
Felix, I have the most terrible news
for you. Andre's dead.

1287
01:30:50,433 --> 01:30:52,805
- Dead?
- It's true. He died in his sleep.

1288
01:30:54,145 --> 01:30:57,265
- That was very considerate of him.
- I don't know what to do.

1289
01:30:57,356 --> 01:31:00,476
The first thing to do is make sure
that he's dead. I don't trust him.

1290
01:31:00,568 --> 01:31:02,607
You can take my word for it.
He's dead, all right.

1291
01:31:02,695 --> 01:31:05,151
We must find a doctor.
The death certificate must be signed.

1292
01:31:05,239 --> 01:31:07,315
We'll go to the Board of Health.

1293
01:31:07,533 --> 01:31:11,531
- Quite a Christmas present.
- Don't misunderstand me.

1294
01:31:12,079 --> 01:31:16,492
It's true that I never liked my cousin,
only because he was not likeable.

1295
01:31:17,752 --> 01:31:21,452
He had a number of good points,
I'm sure. I just can't think of any.

1296
01:31:34,685 --> 01:31:36,927
Yesterday there were three convicts
on the roof.

1297
01:31:37,021 --> 01:31:40,105
Today one of them was in the shop
and told me he was the new assistant.

1298
01:31:40,191 --> 01:31:41,222
Something must be wrong.

1299
01:31:41,317 --> 01:31:43,855
<i>If there were three, madame,
you'd better tell the commandant.</i>

1300
01:31:43,945 --> 01:31:47,563
We have to watch these convicts
and murderers all the time.

1301
01:32:10,304 --> 01:32:13,139
Adolphe.

1302
01:32:15,977 --> 01:32:18,100
- Boys, we've got to get out of here.
- What?

1303
01:32:18,187 --> 01:32:20,939
Your delicious fat friend
has been talking to the authorities.

1304
01:32:21,023 --> 01:32:23,597
- We haven't found Adolphe.
- Adolphe is expendable.

1305
01:32:23,693 --> 01:32:25,436
Can't we even have
a moment of silence?

1306
01:32:25,528 --> 01:32:26,808
We haven't got time.

1307
01:32:26,904 --> 01:32:29,691
Where is everybody? Felix!

1308
01:32:31,325 --> 01:32:32,903
He found my will.

1309
01:32:36,330 --> 01:32:37,872
You. Come here.

1310
01:32:41,127 --> 01:32:44,543
- Where's Felix? I want to talk to him.
- About the will, maybe?

1311
01:32:44,630 --> 01:32:48,046
- No. About the funeral arrangements.
- We'll dig a hole for him.

1312
01:32:48,134 --> 01:32:51,585
I expect the prices will be lower here
than in France, of course.

1313
01:32:51,679 --> 01:32:54,135
Didn't he leave a last will
and testament or something?

1314
01:32:54,223 --> 01:32:58,351
No. I see by the inventory
we have some black armbands in stock.

1315
01:32:58,811 --> 01:33:01,847
- Get me one.
- Wait a minute. About the will.

1316
01:33:02,690 --> 01:33:06,141
You sure you've looked everywhere?
In that briefcase?

1317
01:33:06,319 --> 01:33:08,857
I went through all his papers
very carefully.

1318
01:33:08,946 --> 01:33:11,437
My uncle left no will, none at all.

1319
01:33:12,199 --> 01:33:15,236
So as his nearest relative,
I'll inherit everything.

1320
01:33:18,497 --> 01:33:20,905
Trouble is, I think
everybody's honest but me.

1321
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,787
- I beg your pardon?
- What about Isabelle?

1322
01:33:24,128 --> 01:33:27,046
You're not going to start last night's
farce all over again, are you?

1323
01:33:27,131 --> 01:33:30,167
- It was amusing at the time, but...
- But not quite amusing enough...

1324
01:33:30,259 --> 01:33:31,899
to last a lifetime,
is that what you mean?

1325
01:33:31,969 --> 01:33:34,674
I have a responsibility now.
I must look to the future.

1326
01:33:34,764 --> 01:33:36,756
And the future
does not include Isabelle?

1327
01:33:36,849 --> 01:33:38,224
I'm afraid not.

1328
01:33:38,309 --> 01:33:42,223
With her, it would be marriage or
nothing, and that's out of the question.

1329
01:33:42,313 --> 01:33:46,393
- And Ducotel. What about him?
- I have nothing against Felix.

1330
01:33:46,525 --> 01:33:50,523
He can stay on here, providing,
of course, the inventory's all correct.

1331
01:33:50,613 --> 01:33:54,029
If not, out he goes.
Sentiment has no cash value.

1332
01:33:55,159 --> 01:33:59,536
Now, if you'll excuse me, I think I'd
better take charge of my uncle's things.

1333
01:34:14,971 --> 01:34:17,971
I'll disinherit him.
I'll write another will.

1334
01:34:18,057 --> 01:34:20,429
He'll only get rid of that
like he did the first one.

1335
01:34:20,518 --> 01:34:22,925
- He's as bad as his uncle.
- Worse.

1336
01:34:23,062 --> 01:34:25,731
If we could find Adolphe,
he could do us another favour.

1337
01:34:25,815 --> 01:34:28,566
Adolphe's gone.
He's smarter than we are.

1338
01:34:32,154 --> 01:34:34,610
Do you men know anything about
snakes on this island?

1339
01:34:34,699 --> 01:34:36,905
I've just been bitten by a snake.

1340
01:34:43,457 --> 01:34:46,826
A little snake? About this big?

1341
01:34:47,503 --> 01:34:48,582
Yeah.

1342
01:34:48,671 --> 01:34:51,376
All different colours,
like a pretty bracelet?

1343
01:34:52,091 --> 01:34:54,380
And you could hardly feel it
because it was so quick?

1344
01:34:54,468 --> 01:34:55,548
Yeah.

1345
01:35:04,687 --> 01:35:06,395
I gather it isn't very dangerous.

1346
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:10,181
- Don't worry about a thing.
- Not a thing.

1347
01:35:10,276 --> 01:35:12,315
It's all taken care of.

1348
01:35:12,403 --> 01:35:15,439
Still and all, I'd feel better
if I had a doctor look at it.

1349
01:35:15,531 --> 01:35:18,698
He says he'd feel better
if he had a doctor look at it.

1350
01:35:19,035 --> 01:35:22,534
- He wants to send for a doctor.
- Tell him to save his money.

1351
01:35:23,080 --> 01:35:27,244
He says to save your money.
That's good advice. Take my word for it.

1352
01:35:27,627 --> 01:35:31,874
I guess you're right. It stung at first,
but now I can't feel a thing.

1353
01:35:33,174 --> 01:35:35,629
- Doesn't feel a thing.
- What did he say?

1354
01:35:36,093 --> 01:35:38,631
He says he doesn't feel a thing.

1355
01:35:38,721 --> 01:35:42,671
- In other words, it doesn't hurt a bit.
- Good.

1356
01:35:44,101 --> 01:35:45,893
How did it happen?

1357
01:35:45,978 --> 01:35:48,600
Silliest thing.
He was in my uncle's pocket.

1358
01:35:55,988 --> 01:35:59,191
In his pocket?
What were you doing in his pocket?

1359
01:35:59,283 --> 01:36:00,612
I was just...

1360
01:36:00,701 --> 01:36:03,027
Just going through the books.
We know.

1361
01:36:04,580 --> 01:36:07,154
I'm a little dizzy. I better sit down.

1362
01:36:14,382 --> 01:36:15,580
There.

1363
01:36:16,509 --> 01:36:18,086
Now, where do we want him?

1364
01:36:18,177 --> 01:36:21,427
Well, this place is getting filled up.
The summerhouse.

1365
01:36:21,514 --> 01:36:23,886
He'd look very picturesque
in the summerhouse.

1366
01:36:23,975 --> 01:36:25,683
- Go get Adolphe.
- Yes.

1367
01:36:27,395 --> 01:36:29,019
Where are you taking me?

1368
01:36:29,105 --> 01:36:32,141
Out to the summerhouse
where you can look picturesque.

1369
01:36:32,233 --> 01:36:34,985
You're always taking me out
to the summerhouse!

1370
01:36:36,696 --> 01:36:40,480
Adolphe, you shouldn't hide on us
like that, you little angel, you.

1371
01:36:43,536 --> 01:36:44,615
You got him?

1372
01:36:44,704 --> 01:36:47,621
Yeah. He's all tired out, though,
the poor little guy.

1373
01:36:47,707 --> 01:36:50,957
Gentlemen, the Ducotels
are minus another relative.

1374
01:36:51,544 --> 01:36:55,328
In the immortal words of somebody
or other, "Well done, Adolphe."

1375
01:36:59,051 --> 01:37:00,711
Yes, it was quite quick and painless.

1376
01:37:00,803 --> 01:37:04,254
He left us with a smile on his lips,
and his last words were:

1377
01:37:05,141 --> 01:37:06,552
"No credit."

1378
01:37:19,864 --> 01:37:21,607
How can we tell her?

1379
01:37:22,658 --> 01:37:25,328
Leave it to me.
I'll break it to her gently.

1380
01:37:28,915 --> 01:37:33,292
I kept my promise. I said a prayer
for all of you and Cousin Andre, too.

1381
01:37:34,086 --> 01:37:36,577
That's good, because he's dead.

1382
01:37:38,049 --> 01:37:40,255
I'm glad you broke it to her gently.

1383
01:37:40,676 --> 01:37:44,211
- Cousin Andre's dead?
- Yeah. He died in his sleep...

1384
01:37:44,555 --> 01:37:47,011
after opening his Christmas present.

1385
01:37:47,099 --> 01:37:49,092
I can't believe it. How awful.

1386
01:37:50,478 --> 01:37:52,766
So far, you're the only one
who thinks so.

1387
01:37:52,855 --> 01:37:54,136
Poor Paul.

1388
01:37:54,690 --> 01:37:58,355
- Must have been a terrible shock to him.
- He didn't feel a thing.

1389
01:37:58,986 --> 01:38:01,145
No, he just took it very calmly.

1390
01:38:01,447 --> 01:38:04,697
Stiff upper lip. All that.

1391
01:38:06,118 --> 01:38:08,526
I'd better change my dress
before I talk to Paul.

1392
01:38:08,621 --> 01:38:10,660
I wouldn't want him to think
I'm not sympathetic.

1393
01:38:10,748 --> 01:38:14,117
Before you go, about Paul...
You and Paul, that is.

1394
01:38:14,335 --> 01:38:16,956
It's all right.
I know now that Paul doesn't love me.

1395
01:38:17,046 --> 01:38:21,257
That's no way to remember him. I mean,
only this morning, he was saying...

1396
01:38:22,802 --> 01:38:26,253
Yes, he was. How much he loved you.

1397
01:38:26,889 --> 01:38:29,843
He didn't talk about
anything else but you.

1398
01:38:29,934 --> 01:38:32,389
We wouldn't want you to think of him
not loving you.

1399
01:38:32,478 --> 01:38:34,138
Yes, he loves you.

1400
01:38:35,523 --> 01:38:38,690
I laid awake all last night
thinking about him...

1401
01:38:39,193 --> 01:38:42,360
and I suddenly realised
it was all sort of a fairy tale.

1402
01:38:42,446 --> 01:38:44,854
Something for a child to believe in.

1403
01:38:45,950 --> 01:38:49,650
- Last night I grew up.
- You mean you don't love him anymore?

1404
01:38:50,496 --> 01:38:54,494
I love only you three,
'cause you lied to me.

1405
01:39:05,469 --> 01:39:09,301
- We haven't done so badly after all.
- As long as she's happy.

1406
01:39:13,311 --> 01:39:17,095
Never mind. One day, a nice young man
will come along, just right for her.

1407
01:39:17,189 --> 01:39:20,025
- Only it won't be me.
- That's the way of the world.

1408
01:39:20,109 --> 01:39:22,517
Back in Paris a year ago, if you'd gone...

1409
01:39:22,612 --> 01:39:24,485
around the right corner
at the right time...

1410
01:39:24,572 --> 01:39:27,775
you and Isabelle might have bumped
into each other accidentally.

1411
01:39:27,867 --> 01:39:29,278
"I beg your pardon, miss."

1412
01:39:29,368 --> 01:39:32,951
"Not at all, sir. I should have looked
where I was going."

1413
01:39:33,039 --> 01:39:35,494
- You'd have had a kid by now.
- Yeah.

1414
01:39:35,958 --> 01:39:37,618
As it is, it'll be someone else...

1415
01:39:37,710 --> 01:39:40,877
who comes ringing that doorbell
one of these days.

1416
01:40:00,191 --> 01:40:01,733
Made to order.

1417
01:40:02,610 --> 01:40:04,353
It's predestiny, that's what it is.

1418
01:40:04,445 --> 01:40:06,603
No. It's that fellow from the boat.

1419
01:40:11,410 --> 01:40:12,869
I'm a doctor.

1420
01:40:13,412 --> 01:40:16,117
I was told at the Board of Health
there's been a death here.

1421
01:40:16,207 --> 01:40:19,872
- Is there anything I can do?
- That depends. Are you married?

1422
01:40:20,878 --> 01:40:23,500
- I beg your pardon.
- I said, "Are you married?"

1423
01:40:23,589 --> 01:40:24,620
No.

1424
01:40:25,091 --> 01:40:27,379
It's not bad. He's not bad at all.

1425
01:40:27,468 --> 01:40:30,303
If you don't mind my saying so, Albert,
he's got it all over you.

1426
01:40:30,388 --> 01:40:32,594
I don't see what this has to do
with someone dying here.

1427
01:40:32,682 --> 01:40:35,552
There's no hurry.
Your clients will stay put.

1428
01:40:35,726 --> 01:40:37,683
- You think she'll like him?
- He's pretty good.

1429
01:40:37,770 --> 01:40:41,602
- He's helped by the uniform.
- I think he looks like a glass of milk.

1430
01:40:42,233 --> 01:40:46,065
He seems to be fairly intelligent,
which is more than we hoped for.

1431
01:40:46,237 --> 01:40:48,942
- I still don't see what...
- Don't spoil it.

1432
01:40:50,199 --> 01:40:52,239
Well, what do you say, Albert?

1433
01:40:52,326 --> 01:40:54,200
It's all right with me.

1434
01:40:57,081 --> 01:40:59,572
I can't find Paul. He's not in his room.

1435
01:40:59,667 --> 01:41:01,410
Well, he was in the garden.

1436
01:41:01,502 --> 01:41:05,251
- I have a feeling he may still be there.
- I'm sure he is.

1437
01:41:08,593 --> 01:41:09,921
Excuse me.

1438
01:41:17,310 --> 01:41:20,809
- Who's that young lady?
- She lives here. Nice, isn't she?

1439
01:41:25,276 --> 01:41:27,269
- She looks charming.
- Yes, now, look here.

1440
01:41:27,361 --> 01:41:29,733
You're quite charming yourself,
so you be polite to her...

1441
01:41:29,822 --> 01:41:31,566
and very patient and very kind.

1442
01:41:31,657 --> 01:41:34,279
Or you'll meet a friend of ours
called Adolphe.

1443
01:41:34,368 --> 01:41:36,278
- Will she be back soon?
- That's better.

1444
01:41:36,370 --> 01:41:38,529
As soon as she finds her happiness.

1445
01:41:40,249 --> 01:41:42,456
There. She found it.

1446
01:41:43,794 --> 01:41:46,083
Let me. Out in the garden.

1447
01:41:49,133 --> 01:41:50,627
In the garden.

1448
01:41:54,764 --> 01:41:58,133
- Now I've really lost her.
- You never really had her.

1449
01:41:58,226 --> 01:42:00,930
- It can't be helped.
- I blame it on my uncle.

1450
01:42:01,020 --> 01:42:03,807
If only he'd given me the money
when I asked him for it.

1451
01:42:03,898 --> 01:42:06,982
If only he'd smiled and said,
"Hello, my boy."

1452
01:42:07,068 --> 01:42:10,437
"Hello, my boy. I bet you've come here
to make a touch.

1453
01:42:10,905 --> 01:42:13,610
- "You young devil."
- "I guess I can't fool you, Uncle."

1454
01:42:13,699 --> 01:42:16,190
"No, you can't. I was young once myself.

1455
01:42:17,328 --> 01:42:19,071
"How much do you need?"

1456
01:42:19,163 --> 01:42:22,164
But he didn't say that or anything like it.
So you picked up a poker...

1457
01:42:22,250 --> 01:42:24,326
and let him have it. There you are.

1458
01:42:24,418 --> 01:42:27,253
Here I am.
And they called him the victim.

1459
01:42:32,677 --> 01:42:34,005
She's fainted.

1460
01:42:34,095 --> 01:42:37,713
- In a book I read once, when a girl...
- He's a doctor. He'll think of something.

1461
01:42:37,807 --> 01:42:40,132
- What'll I do?
- Put her down someplace.

1462
01:42:40,226 --> 01:42:43,809
Her room is up those stairs,
but mind her head on the banister.

1463
01:42:44,939 --> 01:42:46,267
All right.

1464
01:42:47,066 --> 01:42:48,691
Charming couple.

1465
01:42:50,528 --> 01:42:51,690
Hello.

1466
01:42:52,613 --> 01:42:55,104
Yeah. On him, she looks good.

1467
01:43:24,937 --> 01:43:27,607
- Is it you?
- It's hard to believe, isn't it?

1468
01:43:27,690 --> 01:43:30,525
- You look different.
- We are different.

1469
01:43:31,152 --> 01:43:33,026
<i>Goodbye, madame. Goodbye, sir.</i>

1470
01:43:33,112 --> 01:43:35,568
- You're leaving?
- Our work is finished.

1471
01:43:36,240 --> 01:43:38,814
- You fixed the roof?
- We fixed everything.

1472
01:43:38,910 --> 01:43:42,741
And now we must be on our way.
Thank you for your hospitality.

1473
01:43:42,830 --> 01:43:45,499
It's been many years
since we've had as nice a Christmas.

1474
01:43:45,583 --> 01:43:47,077
Goodbye.

1475
01:43:47,335 --> 01:43:49,374
Compliments of the season.

1476
01:43:59,931 --> 01:44:01,508
Merry Christmas.

1477
01:44:08,105 --> 01:44:10,775
There's our boat. She's still waiting.

1478
01:44:11,317 --> 01:44:12,776
The rest is easy.

1479
01:44:12,860 --> 01:44:16,443
All we do is get aboard
and leave Devil's Island behind us.

1480
01:44:17,698 --> 01:44:19,738
Funny how it all happened.

1481
01:44:19,992 --> 01:44:23,942
It was kind of a miracle, the whole thing,
almost as though it had been arranged.

1482
01:44:24,038 --> 01:44:26,909
Even the girl herself
called us her angels.

1483
01:44:27,166 --> 01:44:28,791
We're no angels.

1484
01:44:30,002 --> 01:44:32,672
Funny. When I was free,
I was always in trouble.

1485
01:44:32,755 --> 01:44:36,005
I don't know why I'm in such a hurry
to get into trouble again.

1486
01:44:36,092 --> 01:44:39,046
I think they'd be glad to see us
back at prison.

1487
01:44:39,428 --> 01:44:43,806
Well, I'll say one thing for prison.
You meet a better class of people.

1488
01:44:44,100 --> 01:44:46,342
Yes. There's a lot to be said for prison.

1489
01:44:46,435 --> 01:44:48,926
You always know where you are
when you get up in the morning.

1490
01:44:49,021 --> 01:44:51,512
Yes. And I could do with the sleep.

1491
01:44:51,607 --> 01:44:53,979
What do you say? Prison wasn't so bad.

1492
01:44:54,151 --> 01:44:57,318
Let's all go back.
Think of the welcome we'll get.

1493
01:45:01,242 --> 01:45:05,489
If things don't work out right,
we'll do it all over again next year.
