1
00:01:15,292 --> 00:01:17,668
Whenever I get gloomy
with the state of the world,

2
00:01:17,753 --> 00:01:21,130
I think about the arrivals
gate at Heathrow airport.

3
00:01:21,339 --> 00:01:22,715
General opinion
started to make out

4
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,134
that we live in a world
of hatred and greed,

5
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:26,802
but I don't see that.

6
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:29,430
Seems to me that
love is everywhere.

7
00:01:29,639 --> 00:01:32,600
Often it's not particularly
dignified or newsworthy,

8
00:01:32,684 --> 00:01:34,268
but it's always there.

9
00:01:34,352 --> 00:01:36,020
Fathers and sons,
mothers and daughters,

10
00:01:36,104 --> 00:01:37,438
husbands and wives,

11
00:01:37,522 --> 00:01:40,149
boyfriends, girlfriends,
old friends.

12
00:01:41,151 --> 00:01:42,735
When the planes hit
the Twin Towers,

13
00:01:42,819 --> 00:01:45,419
as far as I know, none of the phone
calls from the people on board

14
00:01:45,447 --> 00:01:47,907
were messages of
hate or revenge.

15
00:01:47,991 --> 00:01:50,159
They were all messages of love.

16
00:01:50,494 --> 00:01:52,870
If you look for it, I've
got a sneaky feeling

17
00:01:52,954 --> 00:01:56,624
you'll find that love
actually is all around.

18
00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:15,101
I feel it in my fingers

19
00:02:15,185 --> 00:02:18,604
I feel it in my toes

20
00:02:18,688 --> 00:02:23,442
Feel it in my toes, yeah

21
00:02:23,527 --> 00:02:27,863
Love is all around
me And so the...

22
00:02:28,532 --> 00:02:30,199
I'm afraid you did
it again, Bill.

23
00:02:31,535 --> 00:02:34,870
It's just, I know the old
version so well, you know.

24
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:37,289
Well, we all do.

25
00:02:37,582 --> 00:02:40,000
That's why we're making
the new version.

26
00:02:40,085 --> 00:02:41,627
Right, okay, let's go.

27
00:02:45,257 --> 00:02:47,466
I feel it in my fingers

28
00:02:47,551 --> 00:02:48,592
In my fingers

29
00:02:48,677 --> 00:02:51,679
I feel it in my toes

30
00:02:51,888 --> 00:02:56,058
Feel it in my toes, yeah

31
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,185
Love is all...

32
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:02,064
Fuck, wank, bugger,
shitting ass head and hole.

33
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:05,943
Start again.

34
00:03:11,825 --> 00:03:14,201
I feel it in my fingers

35
00:03:14,286 --> 00:03:15,327
In my fingers

36
00:03:15,412 --> 00:03:18,497
I feel it in my toes

37
00:03:18,582 --> 00:03:23,127
Feel it in my toes, yeah

38
00:03:23,211 --> 00:03:25,504
Christmas is all around me

39
00:03:25,589 --> 00:03:26,630
All around me

40
00:03:26,715 --> 00:03:29,842
And so the feeling grows

41
00:03:29,926 --> 00:03:34,138
So the feeling grows

42
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:36,849
It's written in the wind

43
00:03:36,933 --> 00:03:38,142
Ln the wind

44
00:03:38,226 --> 00:03:40,811
It's everywhere I go

45
00:03:41,188 --> 00:03:45,691
Everywhere I go

46
00:03:45,775 --> 00:03:48,068
So if you really love Christmas

47
00:03:48,153 --> 00:03:49,195
Love Christmas

48
00:03:49,279 --> 00:03:51,822
Come on and let it snow

49
00:03:51,907 --> 00:03:54,033
Come on and let it...

50
00:03:54,117 --> 00:03:56,243
This is shit, isn't it?

51
00:03:56,453 --> 00:03:59,121
Yep, solid gold shit, maestro.

52
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:25,022
God, I'm so late.

53
00:04:25,106 --> 00:04:27,149
It's just round the corner.
You'll make it.

54
00:04:27,442 --> 00:04:30,236
You sure you don't mind
me going without you?

55
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,821
No, really. I'm just
feeling so rotten.

56
00:04:32,948 --> 00:04:34,240
I love you.

57
00:04:34,324 --> 00:04:35,407
I know.

58
00:04:35,492 --> 00:04:39,578
I love you even when you're
sick and look disgusting.

59
00:04:39,996 --> 00:04:43,290
I know. Now, go or you
will actually miss it.

60
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:45,167
Right.

61
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:49,421
Did I mention that I love you?

62
00:04:49,506 --> 00:04:52,383
Yes, you did. Get out, loser.

63
00:05:09,693 --> 00:05:12,403
Karen, it's me again.

64
00:05:12,487 --> 00:05:16,824
I'm sorry, I literally
don't have anyone else to talk to.

65
00:05:17,867 --> 00:05:21,453
Absolutely. Horrible moment right
now, though. Can I call you back?

66
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:22,871
Of course.

67
00:05:22,956 --> 00:05:26,750
Doesn't mean I'm not terribly
concerned that your wife just died.

68
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:28,961
Understood.

69
00:05:29,045 --> 00:05:31,297
Bugger off, call me later.

70
00:05:35,343 --> 00:05:36,844
So what's this big news then?

71
00:05:37,178 --> 00:05:39,138
We've been given our parts
in the nativity play...

72
00:05:39,848 --> 00:05:41,515
And I'm the lobster.

73
00:05:41,599 --> 00:05:43,267
The lobster? Yeah.

74
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,977
In the nativity play?

75
00:05:45,061 --> 00:05:46,854
Yeah. First lobster.

76
00:05:46,938 --> 00:05:50,524
There was more than one lobster
present at the birth of Jesus?

77
00:05:50,608 --> 00:05:51,608
Duh.

78
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,450
Best sandwiches in Britain.

79
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:03,078
Try my lovely nuts?

80
00:06:05,415 --> 00:06:07,916
Beautiful muffin for
a beautiful lady.

81
00:06:11,421 --> 00:06:13,714
Morning, my future wife.

82
00:06:32,233 --> 00:06:33,984
Okay, you can stop there.
Thanks.

83
00:06:34,069 --> 00:06:36,945
I'm gonna need a couple of
orange gels, please, mate.

84
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,631
And by the way, he
introduced me as John,

85
00:06:38,656 --> 00:06:40,157
but actually everyone
calls me Jack.

86
00:06:40,241 --> 00:06:43,160
Fine. Nice to meet you, Jack.

87
00:06:43,495 --> 00:06:45,871
He got me right, though.
I'm just Judy.

88
00:06:45,955 --> 00:06:47,748
Great, Just Judy!

89
00:06:53,004 --> 00:06:55,714
No surprises? No surprises.

90
00:06:55,799 --> 00:06:57,508
Not like the stag night?

91
00:06:57,592 --> 00:06:59,385
Unlike the stag night.

92
00:06:59,469 --> 00:07:01,678
Do you admit the Brazilian
prostitutes were a mistake?

93
00:07:01,763 --> 00:07:03,097
I do.

94
00:07:03,181 --> 00:07:06,558
And it would've been much better if
they'd not turned out to be men?

95
00:07:06,643 --> 00:07:08,644
That is true.

96
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:13,315
Good luck, kiddo.

97
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:39,174
Prime Minister!

98
00:07:50,437 --> 00:07:52,438
Thank you.

99
00:07:54,315 --> 00:07:55,441
Welcome, Prime Minister.

100
00:07:55,525 --> 00:07:58,277
I must work on my wave.

101
00:07:58,695 --> 00:07:59,903
How are you?

102
00:08:00,822 --> 00:08:02,948
How are you feeling?

103
00:08:03,032 --> 00:08:05,159
Cool. Powerful.

104
00:08:05,452 --> 00:08:07,911
Would you like to meet
your household staff?

105
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:10,706
Yes, I would like that
very much indeed.

106
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,833
Anything to put off actually
running the country.

107
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:17,463
This is Terence. He's in charge.

108
00:08:17,547 --> 00:08:19,214
Good morning, sir. Good morning.

109
00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:21,175
I had an uncle
called Terence once.

110
00:08:21,259 --> 00:08:22,801
Hated him. I think
he was a pervert.

111
00:08:22,886 --> 00:08:25,345
But I very much like
the look of you.

112
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:27,806
This is Pat. Hello, Pat.

113
00:08:27,891 --> 00:08:30,309
Good morning, sir.
I'm the housekeeper.

114
00:08:30,393 --> 00:08:32,936
Right. It should be a lot easier
with me than with the last lot.

115
00:08:33,021 --> 00:08:35,772
No nappies, no teenagers,
no scary wife.

116
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:38,734
And this is Natalie.
She's new, like you.

117
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:40,777
Hello, Natalie. Hello, David.

118
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:42,779
I mean, sir.

119
00:08:42,864 --> 00:08:44,948
Shit, I can't believe
I've just said that.

120
00:08:45,033 --> 00:08:48,660
And now I've gone and said "shit." Twice.
I'm so sorry, sir.

121
00:08:49,037 --> 00:08:51,038
It's fine, it's fine. You
could've said "fuck"

122
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:53,415
and then we'd have been in real trouble.
Thank you, sir.

123
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,543
I did have an awful premonition I
was gonna fuck up on my first day.

124
00:08:58,046 --> 00:08:59,213
Oh, piss it!

125
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:05,302
Right, I'll go get my things and then
let's fix the country, shall we?

126
00:09:05,803 --> 00:09:07,679
Yeah, I can't see why not.

127
00:09:21,069 --> 00:09:23,278
It's all right. Did
you see what I did?

128
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:25,072
Yes, I did. I just went...

129
00:09:25,573 --> 00:09:26,573
Hello, there.

130
00:09:26,658 --> 00:09:27,658
I'm right over here.

131
00:09:27,742 --> 00:09:30,911
Yeah, I'm in here. Okay.
Good. Thank you.

132
00:09:37,627 --> 00:09:41,838
Oh, no. That is so inconvenient.

133
00:09:45,468 --> 00:09:48,971
In the presence of God, Peter and
Juliet have given their consent

134
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,473
and made their marriage
vows to each other.

135
00:09:51,558 --> 00:09:54,977
They've declared their marriage by
the giving and receiving of rings.

136
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:58,981
I therefore proclaim that
they are husband and wife.

137
00:10:04,821 --> 00:10:07,531
And you resisted the
temptation for surprises.

138
00:10:07,615 --> 00:10:09,658
Yeah, I'm mature now.

139
00:10:19,836 --> 00:10:22,838
Love, love, love

140
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:27,593
Love, love, love

141
00:10:29,721 --> 00:10:31,179
Did you do this?

142
00:10:32,974 --> 00:10:34,057
No.

143
00:10:34,142 --> 00:10:38,687
Love, love, love, love

144
00:10:40,982 --> 00:10:43,817
There's nothing you can
do that can't be done

145
00:10:43,901 --> 00:10:45,152
Lt...

146
00:10:45,236 --> 00:10:48,280
There's nothing you can
sing that can't be sung

147
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:53,702
There's nothing you can say but you
can learn how to play the game

148
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:57,289
It's easy

149
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:01,043
All you need is love

150
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:06,214
All you need is love

151
00:11:08,426 --> 00:11:12,429
All you need is love, love

152
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:15,599
Love is all you need...

153
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:20,437
Look, it's Pikey.

154
00:11:31,574 --> 00:11:34,242
Hello! What the hell
are you doing here?

155
00:11:34,327 --> 00:11:37,412
I just popped over to
borrow some old CDs.

156
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:38,997
The lady of the house
let you in, did she?

157
00:11:39,082 --> 00:11:40,248
Yeah.

158
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,334
Lovely, obliging girl.

159
00:11:42,418 --> 00:11:43,502
Yeah.

160
00:11:43,586 --> 00:11:45,066
All right, I just
thought I'd pop back

161
00:11:45,129 --> 00:11:46,588
before the reception and
see if she's better.

162
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:51,093
This is good. Listen,
I've been thinking.

163
00:11:51,803 --> 00:11:53,428
I think perhaps we ought to take

164
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:55,972
Mum out for her birthday on Friday.
What do you think?

165
00:11:56,057 --> 00:11:57,766
I just feel we've been
bad sons this year.

166
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:00,686
Okay, sounds fine. A
bit boring but fine.

167
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:02,354
Hurry up, big boy!

168
00:12:02,438 --> 00:12:06,233
I'm naked, and I want you at least
twice before Jamie gets home.

169
00:12:17,412 --> 00:12:19,496
I am so happy to see you!

170
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,332
A delicious delicacy?

171
00:12:22,417 --> 00:12:23,709
No, thanks.

172
00:12:29,465 --> 00:12:31,633
Taste explosion?

173
00:12:43,771 --> 00:12:45,856
Food? No, thanks.

174
00:12:45,982 --> 00:12:49,735
Yeah, a bit dodgy, isn't it?
Looks like a dead baby's finger.

175
00:12:51,738 --> 00:12:54,197
Tastes like it, too.

176
00:12:57,994 --> 00:12:59,828
I'm Colin, by the way.

177
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:02,456
I'm Nancy. Wicked.

178
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:05,083
What do you do, Nancy?
I'm a cook.

179
00:13:05,168 --> 00:13:07,043
Ever do weddings? Yes, I do.

180
00:13:07,128 --> 00:13:08,795
They should've asked
you to do this one.

181
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,297
They did.

182
00:13:10,965 --> 00:13:13,550
God, I wish you hadn't
have turned it down.

183
00:13:13,634 --> 00:13:14,718
I didn't.

184
00:13:14,802 --> 00:13:16,928
Right.

185
00:13:19,682 --> 00:13:21,722
I've just worked out why I
can never find true love.

186
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:22,768
Why is that?

187
00:13:22,852 --> 00:13:25,312
English girls. They're
stuck up, you see.

188
00:13:25,396 --> 00:13:27,522
And I am primarily
attractive to girls

189
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:30,108
who are, you know, cooler,
game for a laugh.

190
00:13:30,193 --> 00:13:34,362
Like American girls. So I
should just go to America.

191
00:13:34,739 --> 00:13:36,782
I would get a girlfriend
there instantly.

192
00:13:36,866 --> 00:13:38,033
What do you think?

193
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:40,076
I think it's crap, Colin.

194
00:13:40,161 --> 00:13:41,828
That's where you're wrong.

195
00:13:41,913 --> 00:13:44,998
American girls would seriously dig
me with my cute British accent.

196
00:13:45,082 --> 00:13:46,708
You don't have a
cute British accent.

197
00:13:46,793 --> 00:13:49,127
Yes, I do! I'm going to America.

198
00:13:49,212 --> 00:13:52,839
Colin, you're a lonely, ugly
asshole, and you must accept it.

199
00:13:52,924 --> 00:13:55,842
Never. I am Colin, God of Sex.

200
00:13:55,927 --> 00:13:57,719
I'm just on the wrong
continent, that's all.

201
00:13:58,221 --> 00:14:01,223
Bit of quiet while we
finish the lighting, guys!

202
00:14:01,766 --> 00:14:03,767
I thought I was never
gonna make it here today.

203
00:14:03,851 --> 00:14:05,602
The traffic was just...
Unbelievable.

204
00:14:05,686 --> 00:14:07,813
Judy, could you take
the top off this time?

205
00:14:07,897 --> 00:14:09,815
Lighting and camera need to
know when we're actually gonna

206
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:12,317
see the nipples and
when we're not.

207
00:14:12,401 --> 00:14:15,987
Yes, okay. Right. At least
it's nice and warm in here.

208
00:14:16,072 --> 00:14:18,240
Yeah. It's not always
the case, is it?

209
00:14:18,366 --> 00:14:21,117
I was standing in for Brad Pitt
once on Seven Years in Tibet...

210
00:14:21,202 --> 00:14:23,578
Yes, yeah. Bloody freezing.

211
00:14:24,121 --> 00:14:26,581
Sorry, guys, time's pretty tight
and we have to get the actors in.

212
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,834
Fine. I promise I won't look.

213
00:14:31,546 --> 00:14:34,047
Right, let's have another
look at that one, please.

214
00:14:46,769 --> 00:14:49,020
And Jerry says if you can just
put your hands on her breasts.

215
00:14:49,105 --> 00:14:50,397
All right, okay, yeah.
Is that all right?

216
00:14:50,481 --> 00:14:51,731
Yes. Yeah, fine.

217
00:14:51,816 --> 00:14:53,608
I'll warm them up.

218
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,154
And massage them, please.

219
00:14:58,239 --> 00:14:59,281
Right.

220
00:15:04,787 --> 00:15:07,122
It's junction 1 3 that's
just murder, isn't it?

221
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:09,499
Total gridlock this morning.

222
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:18,466
Jo and I had a lot of time
to prepare for this moment.

223
00:15:18,801 --> 00:15:21,595
Some of her requests,
for instance,

224
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:26,975
that I should bring Claudia
Schiffer as my date to the funeral,

225
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:30,729
I was confident she
expected me to ignore.

226
00:15:30,813 --> 00:15:34,065
But others she was
pretty damn clear about.

227
00:15:35,359 --> 00:15:38,486
When she first mentioned
what's about to happen,

228
00:15:39,655 --> 00:15:42,073
I said, "Over my dead body."

229
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:45,410
And she said, "No,
Daniel, over mine."

230
00:15:45,494 --> 00:15:48,663
And as usual, my darling girl

231
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,626
and Sam's darling mom was right.

232
00:15:54,337 --> 00:15:59,049
So she's going to say her final
farewell to you not through me but,

233
00:15:59,175 --> 00:16:03,929
inevitably, ever so coolly,

234
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:09,184
through the immortal genius
of the Bay City Rollers.

235
00:17:07,868 --> 00:17:09,119
Do you love him?

236
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:12,539
What?

237
00:17:12,665 --> 00:17:16,001
No, I just thought I'd ask the blunt
question in case it was the right one

238
00:17:16,085 --> 00:17:17,725
and you needed someone
to talk to about it

239
00:17:17,795 --> 00:17:18,837
and no one had ever asked you,

240
00:17:18,921 --> 00:17:21,464
so you've never been able to talk about
it though you might've wanted to.

241
00:17:21,549 --> 00:17:25,760
No. No. No is the answer.
No. Absolutely not.

242
00:17:28,139 --> 00:17:30,098
So that's a no, then?

243
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:31,558
Yes.

244
00:17:37,106 --> 00:17:39,941
This DJ, what do you reckon?

245
00:17:40,151 --> 00:17:42,944
The worst in history? Probably.

246
00:17:43,237 --> 00:17:45,488
I think it all hangs
on the next song.

247
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,365
Now here's one for the lovers.

248
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:50,785
That's quite a few of you, I
shouldn't be surprised and a half.

249
00:17:58,002 --> 00:18:01,421
He's done it, it's official.
Worst DJ in the world.

250
00:18:10,806 --> 00:18:12,640
Sarah's waiting for you.

251
00:18:13,642 --> 00:18:16,144
Yes, of course.

252
00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:19,064
Great, good, good.

253
00:18:19,607 --> 00:18:21,316
How are you doing, Mia?

254
00:18:21,442 --> 00:18:23,443
Are you settling in fine?
Learning who to avoid?

255
00:18:23,527 --> 00:18:25,111
Absolutely.

256
00:18:27,782 --> 00:18:28,907
Harry?

257
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:33,495
Sarah, switch off your
phone and tell me exactly

258
00:18:33,829 --> 00:18:36,122
how long it is that
you've been working here.

259
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:42,045
Two years, seven months,

260
00:18:42,546 --> 00:18:44,881
three days and, I
suppose, what, two hours?

261
00:18:44,965 --> 00:18:49,844
And how long have you been in love with
Karl, our enigmatic chief designer?

262
00:18:56,393 --> 00:18:58,436
Two years, seven
months, three days

263
00:18:58,521 --> 00:19:01,189
and, I suppose, an
hour and 30 minutes.

264
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,816
Thought as much.

265
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,859
Do you think everybody knows?
Yes.

266
00:19:05,236 --> 00:19:07,153
Do you think Karl knows? Yes.

267
00:19:08,364 --> 00:19:11,616
That is... That is bad news.

268
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:15,120
I just thought that
maybe the time had come

269
00:19:15,204 --> 00:19:16,913
to do something about it.

270
00:19:17,915 --> 00:19:19,290
Like what?

271
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:21,751
Invite him out for a drink, and
then after about 20 minutes,

272
00:19:21,836 --> 00:19:24,420
casually drop into the conversation
the fact that you'd like to marry him

273
00:19:24,505 --> 00:19:25,505
and have lots of sex and babies.

274
00:19:25,589 --> 00:19:27,841
You know that? Yes.

275
00:19:29,009 --> 00:19:30,552
And so does Karl.

276
00:19:31,512 --> 00:19:33,471
Think about it, for
all our sakes.

277
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,099
It's Christmas.

278
00:19:37,893 --> 00:19:42,438
Certainly. Excellent. Will do.
Thanks, boss.

279
00:19:45,442 --> 00:19:46,651
Hi, Sarah. Hi, Karl.

280
00:19:46,735 --> 00:19:47,735
Excuse me.

281
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,541
Babe. Absolutely, fire away.

282
00:20:02,585 --> 00:20:05,003
Mia, Mia, would you
turn that down?

283
00:20:06,964 --> 00:20:08,089
What is that?

284
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:12,218
And that was the Christmas effort
by the once great Billy Mack.

285
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:15,180
Oh, dear me, how are
the mighty fallen.

286
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:16,764
I can safely put my
hand up my ass and say

287
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:20,435
that is the worst record
I've heard this century...

288
00:20:21,103 --> 00:20:25,148
And, coincidentally, I believe
Billy will be a guest

289
00:20:25,232 --> 00:20:27,942
on my friend Mike's show
in a few minutes' time.

290
00:20:28,736 --> 00:20:30,820
Welcome back, Bill.

291
00:20:30,905 --> 00:20:33,323
So, Billy, welcome
back to the airwaves.

292
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:36,701
New Christmas single, cover
of Love Is All Around.

293
00:20:36,785 --> 00:20:41,915
Except we've changed the
word "love" to "Christmas."

294
00:20:42,082 --> 00:20:45,251
Yes, is that an important
message to you, Bill?

295
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:47,462
Not really, Mike.

296
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:52,175
Christmas is a time for people with
someone they love in their lives.

297
00:20:52,259 --> 00:20:54,719
And that's not you?
That's not me, Michael.

298
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:58,765
When I was young and successful,
I was greedy and foolish,

299
00:20:58,849 --> 00:21:02,810
and now I'm left with no
one, wrinkled and alone.

300
00:21:03,187 --> 00:21:05,855
Wow. Thanks for that, Bill.
For what?

301
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,691
Well, for actually giving a
real answer to a question.

302
00:21:08,776 --> 00:21:12,320
It doesn't often happen here at
Radio Watford, I can tell you.

303
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:14,739
Ask me anything you like, and
I'll tell you the truth.

304
00:21:14,823 --> 00:21:16,407
Best shag you ever had?

305
00:21:16,492 --> 00:21:17,575
Britney Spears.

306
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:18,660
Wow.

307
00:21:19,662 --> 00:21:21,162
No, only kidding!

308
00:21:21,247 --> 00:21:22,789
She was rubbish.

309
00:21:22,873 --> 00:21:24,165
Okay, here's one.

310
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:28,586
How do you think the new record
compares to your old, classic stuff?

311
00:21:28,837 --> 00:21:32,257
Come on, Mikey, you know as
well as I do the record's crap.

312
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:37,303
But wouldn't it be great if
number one this Christmas

313
00:21:37,388 --> 00:21:39,764
wasn't some smug teenager

314
00:21:39,848 --> 00:21:44,143
but an old ex-heroin addict searching
for a comeback at any price?

315
00:21:44,395 --> 00:21:46,437
All those young popsters
come Christmas day,

316
00:21:46,522 --> 00:21:50,316
they'll be stretched out naked with a
cute bird balancing on their balls

317
00:21:50,567 --> 00:21:54,112
and I'll be stuck in some dingy
flat with me manager, Joe,

318
00:21:54,196 --> 00:21:56,197
ugliest man in the world,

319
00:21:56,699 --> 00:22:00,493
fucking miserable because our
fucking gamble didn't pay off.

320
00:22:00,577 --> 00:22:05,623
So if you believe in Father Christmas,
children, like your Uncle Billy does,

321
00:22:06,292 --> 00:22:09,961
buy my festering
turd of a record.

322
00:22:10,212 --> 00:22:13,172
And particularly enjoy
the incredible crassness

323
00:22:13,257 --> 00:22:17,385
of the moment when we try to squeeze an
extra syllable into the fourth line.

324
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:19,971
I think you're referring to,

325
00:22:20,055 --> 00:22:22,557
"If you really
love Christmas..."

326
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:24,559
"Come on and let it snow."

327
00:22:25,769 --> 00:22:27,812
So, here it is one more time,

328
00:22:27,896 --> 00:22:31,232
the dark horse for this
year's Christmas number one,

329
00:22:31,358 --> 00:22:34,152
Christmas ls All Around.
Thank you, Billy.

330
00:22:34,236 --> 00:22:35,570
After this, the news.

331
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:38,406
Is the new prime minister
in trouble already?

332
00:22:44,413 --> 00:22:45,955
Okay. What's next?

333
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,206
The President's visit.

334
00:22:47,291 --> 00:22:50,877
Yes, yes. I fear this is going
to be a difficult one to play.

335
00:22:50,961 --> 00:22:52,086
Alex.

336
00:22:52,463 --> 00:22:54,881
There's a very strong
feeling in the party

337
00:22:54,965 --> 00:22:56,799
we mustn't allow
ourselves to be bullied

338
00:22:56,884 --> 00:22:58,092
from pillar to post like
the last government.

339
00:22:58,177 --> 00:22:59,218
Hear, hear.

340
00:22:59,303 --> 00:23:01,721
This is our first
really important test.

341
00:23:01,805 --> 00:23:03,348
Let's take a stand.

342
00:23:03,432 --> 00:23:08,311
Right. Right. I understand
that, but I have decided

343
00:23:09,772 --> 00:23:11,731
not to. Not this time.

344
00:23:12,024 --> 00:23:13,691
We will, of course,
try to be clever.

345
00:23:13,776 --> 00:23:16,361
But let's not forget that America is the
most powerful country in the world.

346
00:23:16,445 --> 00:23:18,821
I'm not going to act
like a petulant child.

347
00:23:21,241 --> 00:23:22,533
Right, who do you have
to screw around here

348
00:23:22,618 --> 00:23:24,911
to get a cup of tea and
a chocolate biscuit?

349
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,086
Right.

350
00:23:35,422 --> 00:23:36,631
Yeah, come in.

351
00:23:41,804 --> 00:23:46,641
These have just come through from
the treasury and these are for you.

352
00:23:47,851 --> 00:23:49,435
Excellent. Thanks a lot.

353
00:23:49,978 --> 00:23:51,979
I was hoping you'd win,

354
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:53,731
not that I wouldn't have been
nice to the other bloke, too.

355
00:23:53,816 --> 00:23:56,442
Just always given him the boring
biscuits with no chocolate.

356
00:23:57,694 --> 00:23:59,570
Thanks very much. Thanks...

357
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,324
Natalie.

358
00:24:07,871 --> 00:24:12,583
God, come on, get a grip. You're the
prime minister, for God's sake.

359
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:17,422
So what do you reckon to our
new prime minister then?

360
00:24:17,506 --> 00:24:21,801
I like him. I can't understand
why he's not married, though.

361
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:25,096
You know the type, he's
married to his job.

362
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:28,266
Either that or gay
as a picnic basket.

363
00:24:28,434 --> 00:24:31,686
Excuse me, Judy, if you could
just lower the nipples

364
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:32,937
and cheat them a
bit to the left?

365
00:24:33,021 --> 00:24:34,147
Okay.

366
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:40,278
I have to say, Judy,
this is a real pleasure.

367
00:24:40,362 --> 00:24:43,990
It's lovely to find someone
I can actually chat to.

368
00:24:44,199 --> 00:24:46,200
Thank you. Well, you know...

369
00:24:46,368 --> 00:24:47,910
And ditto. Thank you.

370
00:24:48,036 --> 00:24:49,704
And the move again,
please, Judy.

371
00:24:50,456 --> 00:24:51,747
Sorry. God, sorry.

372
00:24:51,832 --> 00:24:53,032
Are you all right? Yeah, fine.

373
00:24:56,003 --> 00:24:57,879
Exciting news!

374
00:24:57,963 --> 00:24:58,963
What?

375
00:24:59,047 --> 00:25:02,508
I've bought a ticket to the States.
I'm off in three weeks.

376
00:25:02,593 --> 00:25:03,968
No. Yes!

377
00:25:04,052 --> 00:25:07,013
To a fantastic place
called Wisconsin.

378
00:25:07,097 --> 00:25:08,097
No!

379
00:25:08,223 --> 00:25:11,809
Yes! Wisconsin
babes, here comes Sir Colin!

380
00:25:11,894 --> 00:25:16,439
No, Col! There are a few babes
in America, I grant you,

381
00:25:16,523 --> 00:25:19,192
but they're already going out
with rich, attractive guys.

382
00:25:19,276 --> 00:25:22,153
Tone, you're just jealous.

383
00:25:22,237 --> 00:25:26,199
You know perfectly well that
any bar anywhere in America

384
00:25:26,283 --> 00:25:30,661
contains 1 0 girls more beautiful
and more likely to have sex with me

385
00:25:30,746 --> 00:25:32,205
than the whole of
the United Kingdom.

386
00:25:32,289 --> 00:25:35,291
That is total bollocks.
You've actually gone mad now.

387
00:25:35,375 --> 00:25:40,338
No, I'm wise. Stateside I am Prince
William without the weird family.

388
00:25:40,464 --> 00:25:42,089
No, Colin, no!

389
00:25:42,174 --> 00:25:43,883
Yes!

390
00:25:44,051 --> 00:25:45,593
Ja, darling!

391
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:49,055
Right, the Christmas party, not
my favorite night of the year

392
00:25:49,139 --> 00:25:51,641
and your unhappy
job to organize.

393
00:25:51,892 --> 00:25:53,017
Tell me.

394
00:25:53,101 --> 00:25:54,644
It's basic, really.

395
00:25:54,728 --> 00:25:58,689
Find a venue, over-order on the
drinks, bulk buy the guacamole

396
00:25:58,774 --> 00:26:02,610
and advise the girls to avoid Kevin
if they want their breasts unfondled.

397
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:05,029
Wives and family and stuff?

398
00:26:05,113 --> 00:26:07,198
Yeah. I mean, not children.

399
00:26:07,282 --> 00:26:10,743
But their wives and
girlfriends, et cetera.

400
00:26:10,827 --> 00:26:13,704
Oh, Christ, you haven't got
some horrible six-foot,

401
00:26:13,789 --> 00:26:16,624
tight-T-shirt-wearing boyfriend
you'll be bringing, have you?

402
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:21,379
No. I'll just be hanging around the
mistletoe, hoping to be kissed.

403
00:26:23,006 --> 00:26:24,131
Really?

404
00:26:25,634 --> 00:26:26,634
Right.

405
00:26:36,979 --> 00:26:39,313
He now spends all the
time in his room.

406
00:26:39,398 --> 00:26:40,856
I mean, he'll be up there now.

407
00:26:40,941 --> 00:26:44,193
That's nothing unusual about that.
My horrid son...

408
00:26:44,278 --> 00:26:45,403
Bernard? Bernard.

409
00:26:45,487 --> 00:26:49,240
Stays in his room all the time.
Thank goodness.

410
00:26:49,324 --> 00:26:51,951
Yeah, but, Karen,
this is all the time.

411
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:57,039
I'm afraid that there's something
really wrong, you know?

412
00:26:57,916 --> 00:26:59,417
I mean, clearly
it's about his mom,

413
00:26:59,501 --> 00:27:04,589
but, Christ, he might be injecting
heroin into his eyeballs for all I know.

414
00:27:05,424 --> 00:27:06,924
At the age of 1 1?

415
00:27:07,009 --> 00:27:09,302
Well, maybe not
his eyeballs, then.

416
00:27:09,386 --> 00:27:11,345
Maybe just his veins.

417
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:13,347
You see, the problem
is it was his mom

418
00:27:13,432 --> 00:27:16,017
who always used to talk
to him, you know, and...

419
00:27:17,352 --> 00:27:20,646
I don't know, this
whole stepfather thing

420
00:27:20,731 --> 00:27:24,942
seems suddenly to somehow matter
like it never did before.

421
00:27:25,027 --> 00:27:29,697
Listen, it was always going
to be a totally shit time.

422
00:27:30,032 --> 00:27:31,198
Just be patient.

423
00:27:32,576 --> 00:27:34,952
And maybe check the
room for needles.

424
00:27:35,037 --> 00:27:37,538
And then when he
sometimes does come out,

425
00:27:37,623 --> 00:27:39,707
it's obvious he's been crying.

426
00:27:49,092 --> 00:27:52,553
It's just such a
ridiculous waste.

427
00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:56,057
And now if it's going to
ruin Sam's life as well...

428
00:27:57,392 --> 00:27:58,851
I just don't know.

429
00:28:00,604 --> 00:28:04,732
Get a grip. People hate sissies.

430
00:28:05,233 --> 00:28:07,943
No one's ever gonna shag you
if you cry all the time.

431
00:28:08,612 --> 00:28:11,447
Yeah. Absolutely.

432
00:28:11,573 --> 00:28:13,574
Helpful.

433
00:28:21,416 --> 00:28:25,419
So, what's the problem, Samuel?

434
00:28:27,047 --> 00:28:31,592
Is it just Mom or is
it something else?

435
00:28:33,428 --> 00:28:35,471
Maybe school?

436
00:28:36,515 --> 00:28:38,432
Are you being bullied?

437
00:28:39,893 --> 00:28:41,977
Or is it something worse?

438
00:28:43,897 --> 00:28:46,273
Can you give me
any clues at all?

439
00:28:47,651 --> 00:28:49,735
You really want to know?

440
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:51,195
I really want to know.

441
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:53,698
Even though you won't be
able to do anything to help?

442
00:28:53,782 --> 00:28:56,242
Even if that's the case, yeah.

443
00:28:58,203 --> 00:29:00,663
Okay. Well...

444
00:29:01,832 --> 00:29:04,417
Truth is, actually,

445
00:29:05,627 --> 00:29:06,836
I'm in love.

446
00:29:07,629 --> 00:29:09,213
Sorry?

447
00:29:09,381 --> 00:29:11,966
I know I should be thinking about
Mom all the time and I am,

448
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:13,718
but the truth is I'm in love.

449
00:29:13,802 --> 00:29:16,429
I was before she died, and there's
nothing I can do about it.

450
00:29:18,056 --> 00:29:21,392
Aren't you a bit
young to be in love?

451
00:29:21,476 --> 00:29:22,476
No.

452
00:29:22,561 --> 00:29:25,312
Well, okay, well...

453
00:29:27,149 --> 00:29:29,650
I mean, I'm a little relieved.

454
00:29:30,777 --> 00:29:32,737
Why? Because I

455
00:29:32,821 --> 00:29:34,822
thought it would be
something worse.

456
00:29:35,449 --> 00:29:38,325
Worse than the total
agony of being in love?

457
00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:44,832
No, you're right. Total agony.

458
00:30:22,996 --> 00:30:24,246
Night, Sarah.

459
00:30:24,331 --> 00:30:25,331
Night, Karl.

460
00:30:35,217 --> 00:30:37,218
Yeah, absolutely.

461
00:30:38,637 --> 00:30:40,262
Free as a bird. Fire away.

462
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:14,255
Alone again.

463
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:16,715
Naturally.

464
00:31:17,425 --> 00:31:18,717
I'll deal with it.

465
00:31:18,802 --> 00:31:19,927
All right.

466
00:31:21,638 --> 00:31:23,597
Natalie. Sir.

467
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:29,228
Thanks. Natalie.

468
00:31:32,148 --> 00:31:34,859
I'm starting to feel

469
00:31:36,695 --> 00:31:40,155
uncomfortable about us working in
such close proximity every day

470
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,490
and me knowing so
little about you.

471
00:31:41,575 --> 00:31:44,743
It seems... Lt seems
elitist and wrong.

472
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:47,121
Well, there's not much to know.

473
00:31:47,455 --> 00:31:50,749
Well, where do you
live, for instance?

474
00:31:50,959 --> 00:31:53,043
Wandsworth. The dodgy end.

475
00:31:53,628 --> 00:31:56,839
My sister lives in Wandsworth.
Yeah.

476
00:31:57,966 --> 00:32:00,301
So which exactly
is the dodgy end?

477
00:32:00,635 --> 00:32:02,177
Right at the end of
the High Street,

478
00:32:02,262 --> 00:32:04,138
Harris Street, near
the Queen's Head.

479
00:32:04,514 --> 00:32:06,557
Yeah, yeah, that is dodgy.

480
00:32:06,975 --> 00:32:11,478
And you live with your husband?
Boyfriend?

481
00:32:12,522 --> 00:32:14,398
Three illegitimate but
charming children?

482
00:32:14,482 --> 00:32:15,482
No.

483
00:32:15,567 --> 00:32:17,234
I've just split up with
my boyfriend, actually,

484
00:32:17,319 --> 00:32:19,945
so I'm back with my mom
and dad for a while.

485
00:32:21,698 --> 00:32:22,990
Sorry.

486
00:32:23,074 --> 00:32:24,742
No, it's fine.

487
00:32:24,826 --> 00:32:28,746
I'm well shot of him. He
said I was getting fat.

488
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:29,914
I beg your pardon?

489
00:32:29,998 --> 00:32:33,667
He said no one's gonna fancy a girl with
thighs the size of big tree trunks.

490
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:36,670
Not a nice guy,
actually, in the end.

491
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,341
No.

492
00:32:47,515 --> 00:32:49,600
You know,

493
00:32:50,226 --> 00:32:53,270
being prime minister, I could
just have him murdered.

494
00:32:54,522 --> 00:32:56,815
Thank you, sir. I'll
think about it.

495
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:00,945
Do. The SAS are
absolutely charming.

496
00:33:01,029 --> 00:33:04,865
Ruthless, trained killers
are just a phone call away.

497
00:33:10,705 --> 00:33:12,706
Oh, God.

498
00:33:15,418 --> 00:33:17,461
Did you have this
kind of problem?

499
00:33:20,006 --> 00:33:22,383
Yeah, course you
did, you saucy minx.

500
00:33:22,801 --> 00:33:26,053
So, let's go. We can
definitely crack this.

501
00:33:26,388 --> 00:33:28,681
Remember, I was a kid once, too.

502
00:33:29,015 --> 00:33:33,143
So, come on, it's someone at school.
Right?

503
00:33:33,228 --> 00:33:34,895
Yeah. Good, good.

504
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:38,190
And what does she,
he, feel about you?

505
00:33:38,274 --> 00:33:41,110
She doesn't even know my name.

506
00:33:41,236 --> 00:33:43,862
And even if she did,
she'd despise me.

507
00:33:44,197 --> 00:33:46,407
She's the coolest
girl in school,

508
00:33:46,574 --> 00:33:48,659
and everyone worships her
because she's heaven.

509
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:53,247
Good. Good.

510
00:33:54,582 --> 00:33:59,336
Well, basically
you're fucked, aren't you?

511
00:34:05,593 --> 00:34:08,053
Hi there, and welcome back.

512
00:34:08,138 --> 00:34:10,347
So, Billy, three weeks
till Christmas,

513
00:34:10,432 --> 00:34:12,641
looks like the real
competition is gonna be Blue.

514
00:34:12,726 --> 00:34:15,144
Yeah, I saw them on
the show last week.

515
00:34:15,228 --> 00:34:17,021
They weren't very
nice about my record.

516
00:34:17,105 --> 00:34:18,647
No. Little scamps.

517
00:34:19,816 --> 00:34:23,068
But very, very
talented musicians.

518
00:34:23,778 --> 00:34:27,156
Yeah. Billy, I understand you've got
a prize for our competition winners.

519
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:32,870
Yes, I have, Ant or Dec. It's
a personalized felt-tip pen.

520
00:34:33,204 --> 00:34:34,580
Great.

521
00:34:34,664 --> 00:34:38,333
It's brilliant. Lt
even writes on glass,

522
00:34:38,752 --> 00:34:40,878
so if you've got a
framed picture,

523
00:34:40,962 --> 00:34:43,213
like, for instance,
this one of Blue,

524
00:34:43,298 --> 00:34:45,299
you can just write on it.

525
00:34:59,189 --> 00:35:01,690
A lot of kids watching, Billy.

526
00:35:01,775 --> 00:35:02,816
Yeah.

527
00:35:03,568 --> 00:35:06,070
Hiya, kids.

528
00:35:06,154 --> 00:35:09,406
Here's an important message
from your Uncle Bill.

529
00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:11,658
Don't buy drugs.

530
00:35:13,953 --> 00:35:16,622
Become a pop star and they
give you them for free.

531
00:35:16,748 --> 00:35:19,249
And I do believe
it's a commercial break.

532
00:35:19,334 --> 00:35:21,752
Thank goodness. We'll see you soon.
Bye-bye.

533
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:36,016
Look at him!

534
00:35:36,101 --> 00:35:37,976
Just a minute.

535
00:35:38,061 --> 00:35:40,646
Actually, they're not funny.
They're art.

536
00:35:45,151 --> 00:35:47,653
Okay, let's say
Thursday, my place.

537
00:35:47,987 --> 00:35:50,114
Great. But for now I've got
Juliet on the other line.

538
00:35:50,198 --> 00:35:52,318
Can I patch you through? She
wants to ask you a favor.

539
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,159
Okay, fine.

540
00:35:54,244 --> 00:35:57,371
Thanks and be nice.

541
00:35:57,455 --> 00:35:58,872
I'm always nice.

542
00:35:58,957 --> 00:36:02,376
You know what I mean,
Marky, be friendly.

543
00:36:02,544 --> 00:36:04,378
Mark?

544
00:36:05,046 --> 00:36:07,840
Hi. How was the honeymoon?

545
00:36:08,091 --> 00:36:10,801
It was great. And thanks
for the gorgeous sendoff.

546
00:36:11,261 --> 00:36:12,553
So, what can I do for you?

547
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:14,388
It's only a tiny favor.

548
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:17,349
I've just tried the wedding video,
and it's a complete disaster.

549
00:36:17,433 --> 00:36:19,351
It's come out all
blue and wibbly.

550
00:36:19,435 --> 00:36:20,477
I'm sorry.

551
00:36:20,562 --> 00:36:22,604
I remember you filming
a lot in the day

552
00:36:22,689 --> 00:36:24,189
and I just wondered if I
could look at your stuff.

553
00:36:24,566 --> 00:36:26,483
No, look, to be honest,
I didn't really...

554
00:36:26,568 --> 00:36:29,695
Please. All I want is just one
shot of me in a wedding dress

555
00:36:29,821 --> 00:36:31,113
that isn't bright turquoise.

556
00:36:31,906 --> 00:36:34,627
Okay, I'll have a look, but to be
honest, I'm pretty sure I wiped it,

557
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:36,451
so don't get any hopes up.

558
00:36:36,536 --> 00:36:37,786
Must go.

559
00:36:44,002 --> 00:36:46,545
Any progress with our
matchmaking plans?

560
00:36:46,629 --> 00:36:50,674
No. I've done fuck-all and never
will because he's too good for me.

561
00:36:50,758 --> 00:36:52,759
How true.

562
00:36:54,721 --> 00:36:56,138
Stop.

563
00:36:56,222 --> 00:36:58,348
And, of course,
your mobile goes.

564
00:36:59,684 --> 00:37:02,311
Hello. Hi. How you doing?

565
00:37:03,313 --> 00:37:05,147
So, how's the Christmas
party going?

566
00:37:05,231 --> 00:37:06,273
Good.

567
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:08,567
Think I've found a venue.
Friend of mine works there.

568
00:37:08,651 --> 00:37:10,360
What's it like?

569
00:37:10,445 --> 00:37:11,862
Good. Good.

570
00:37:12,113 --> 00:37:17,117
It's an art gallery. Full of dark
corners for doing dark deeds.

571
00:37:20,747 --> 00:37:21,788
Right.

572
00:37:22,957 --> 00:37:25,209
Good. Well, I suppose I should

573
00:37:25,293 --> 00:37:26,960
take a look at it or something.

574
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:29,463
You should.

575
00:37:50,652 --> 00:37:54,488
Welcome back. And this year
you bring a lady guest?

576
00:37:54,614 --> 00:37:57,658
No. There's a change of situation.
Just me.

577
00:37:57,992 --> 00:38:00,202
Am I sad or not sad?

578
00:38:00,286 --> 00:38:01,954
I think you're not surprised.

579
00:38:02,038 --> 00:38:03,914
And you stay here
till Christmas?

580
00:38:03,998 --> 00:38:04,998
Yeah, yeah.

581
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:10,087
Good. Well, I find you a perfect
lady to clean the house.

582
00:38:10,463 --> 00:38:12,839
This is Aurelia.

583
00:38:25,144 --> 00:38:29,273
Unfortunately, she cannot
speak French, just like you.

584
00:38:29,691 --> 00:38:31,483
She's Portuguese.

585
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:42,703
I think she's 1 0 years
too young to remember

586
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:44,955
there was a footballer
called Eusebio.

587
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:47,291
And "molto bueno" is Spanish.

588
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:49,001
Right. Right.

589
00:38:49,127 --> 00:38:51,878
Anyway, it's nice
to meet you and...

590
00:38:52,505 --> 00:38:54,631
Perhaps you can drive her
home at the end of her work?

591
00:38:54,716 --> 00:38:55,757
Absolutely, yes.

592
00:38:58,553 --> 00:39:00,721
Which is what? Turkish?

593
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:25,454
No, right. Silence is golden.

594
00:39:27,582 --> 00:39:29,708
As the Tremeloes said.

595
00:39:31,794 --> 00:39:34,629
Clever guys, although I
think the original version

596
00:39:34,714 --> 00:39:38,467
was by Frankie Valli
& the Four Seasons.

597
00:39:38,801 --> 00:39:40,552
Great band.

598
00:39:43,264 --> 00:39:44,681
Shut up.

599
00:39:56,361 --> 00:39:58,111
Mr. President!

600
00:39:59,614 --> 00:40:00,739
Over here, sir!

601
00:40:00,823 --> 00:40:02,324
What will you be talking about?

602
00:40:05,328 --> 00:40:06,703
Mr. President, welcome.

603
00:40:06,788 --> 00:40:08,038
It's a pleasure to meet you.

604
00:40:08,122 --> 00:40:09,331
Come on through.

605
00:40:09,415 --> 00:40:10,791
I'm sorry your wife couldn't
make it, by the way.

606
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:13,960
So is she. Although she would have
been kind of lonely, I'm sure.

607
00:40:14,337 --> 00:40:18,673
Yes. Pathetic, isn't it? Just never
been able to tie a girl down.

608
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,676
Not sure that politics and
dating really go together.

609
00:40:21,761 --> 00:40:24,596
Really? I've never found that.

610
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,681
Yeah, well, the difference is
you're still sickeningly handsome,

611
00:40:26,766 --> 00:40:29,434
whereas I look increasingly
like my Aunt Mildred.

612
00:40:29,811 --> 00:40:31,395
Very jealous of your
plane, by the way.

613
00:40:31,479 --> 00:40:34,231
Thank you. We love that
thing, I'll tell you.

614
00:40:34,315 --> 00:40:36,233
Natalie. Hi.

615
00:40:36,317 --> 00:40:38,819
Morning, ma'am. How's
your day so far?

616
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:42,072
Excellent.

617
00:40:45,284 --> 00:40:48,161
My goodness, that's a pretty little
son of a bitch, right there.

618
00:40:48,246 --> 00:40:50,205
Did you see those pipes?

619
00:40:50,498 --> 00:40:53,667
Yeah, yeah, she's
terrific at her job.

620
00:40:54,168 --> 00:40:58,463
No, absolutely not. We cannot and
will not consult on that, either.

621
00:40:58,548 --> 00:41:00,382
That is unexpected.

622
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:02,843
Well, it shouldn't be.

623
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:05,971
The last administration
made it perfectly clear.

624
00:41:06,347 --> 00:41:08,515
We're just being consistent
with their policies.

625
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:11,351
Well, with all respect, sir,
they were bad policies.

626
00:41:12,103 --> 00:41:13,437
All right, thanks, Alex.

627
00:41:13,521 --> 00:41:19,192
I don't think we're making progress here.
Let's move on, shall we?

628
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:25,198
Well, now, that was
an interesting day.

629
00:41:26,951 --> 00:41:28,493
Sorry if our line was firm,

630
00:41:28,578 --> 00:41:30,579
but there's no point in
tiptoeing around today,

631
00:41:30,663 --> 00:41:33,373
then just disappointing
you for four years.

632
00:41:33,833 --> 00:41:36,626
I mean, I have plans and I
plan to see them through.

633
00:41:36,711 --> 00:41:39,629
Absolutely. Now, there is one final
thing I think we should look at.

634
00:41:39,714 --> 00:41:42,799
It's very close to my heart.
Just give me a second.

635
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:45,427
I'll give you
anything you ask for.

636
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:48,722
As long as it's not something
I don't wanna give.

637
00:41:53,769 --> 00:41:55,437
Hi.

638
00:41:55,521 --> 00:41:57,522
Pathetic.

639
00:42:18,586 --> 00:42:19,920
It's great Scotch.

640
00:42:21,923 --> 00:42:24,591
I'll... I'll be going, then.

641
00:42:27,136 --> 00:42:29,012
Natalie,

642
00:42:29,388 --> 00:42:32,432
I hope to see much more of you
as our two great countries

643
00:42:32,517 --> 00:42:34,100
work toward a better future.

644
00:42:34,936 --> 00:42:36,102
Thank you, sir.

645
00:42:53,579 --> 00:42:55,288
Yes, Peter.

646
00:42:55,373 --> 00:42:57,499
Mr. President, has it
been a good visit?

647
00:42:58,125 --> 00:43:00,752
Very satisfactory indeed.

648
00:43:00,836 --> 00:43:03,296
We got what we came for,

649
00:43:04,006 --> 00:43:07,050
and our special relationship
is still very special.

650
00:43:07,134 --> 00:43:09,469
And, Prime Minister?

651
00:43:10,096 --> 00:43:11,930
I love that word "relationship."

652
00:43:12,014 --> 00:43:14,182
Covers all manner of
sins, doesn't it?

653
00:43:14,642 --> 00:43:18,311
I fear that this has
become a bad relationship,

654
00:43:19,355 --> 00:43:23,316
a relationship based on the President
taking exactly what he wants

655
00:43:23,568 --> 00:43:28,446
and casually ignoring all those
things that really matter to

656
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:33,368
Britain.

657
00:43:33,452 --> 00:43:37,414
We may be a small country,
but we're a great one, too.

658
00:43:38,249 --> 00:43:40,959
The country of Shakespeare,
Churchill, The Beatles,

659
00:43:41,043 --> 00:43:42,752
Sean Connery, Harry Potter.

660
00:43:44,297 --> 00:43:49,676
David Beckham's right foot. David
Beckham's left foot, come to that.

661
00:43:50,136 --> 00:43:53,847
And a friend who bullies
us is no longer a friend.

662
00:43:54,098 --> 00:43:57,350
And since bullies only respond
to strength, from now onward,

663
00:43:58,019 --> 00:44:01,104
I will be prepared
to be much stronger.

664
00:44:01,188 --> 00:44:02,989
And the President should
be prepared for that.

665
00:44:14,368 --> 00:44:16,369
Mr. President!

666
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:22,125
Joe.

667
00:44:22,793 --> 00:44:24,919
It's your sister on line four.

668
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:27,714
All right.

669
00:44:28,424 --> 00:44:31,009
Yes, I'm very busy and important.
How can I help you?

670
00:44:31,093 --> 00:44:33,136
Have you gone completely insane?

671
00:44:33,346 --> 00:44:34,804
You can't be sensible
all the time.

672
00:44:34,889 --> 00:44:36,640
You can if you're
prime minister.

673
00:44:36,724 --> 00:44:38,892
Oh, dear, it's the Chancellor of
the Exchequer on the other line.

674
00:44:38,976 --> 00:44:40,143
No, it isn't! I'll
call you back.

675
00:44:40,227 --> 00:44:41,227
No, you won't!

676
00:44:44,565 --> 00:44:46,483
The trouble with being the
prime minister's sister is

677
00:44:46,567 --> 00:44:49,653
it does put your life into
rather harsh perspective.

678
00:44:50,488 --> 00:44:53,657
What did my brother do today? He
stood up and fought for his country.

679
00:44:53,741 --> 00:44:58,036
And what did I do? I made a
papier-mâché lobster head.

680
00:44:58,245 --> 00:45:00,789
What is this we're listening to?

681
00:45:00,956 --> 00:45:03,083
Joni Mitchell.

682
00:45:03,292 --> 00:45:06,086
I can't believe you still
listen to Joni Mitchell.

683
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:09,756
I love her and true
love lasts a lifetime.

684
00:45:11,258 --> 00:45:13,009
Joni Mitchell is the
woman who taught

685
00:45:13,094 --> 00:45:16,179
your cold English
wife how to feel.

686
00:45:16,263 --> 00:45:17,344
Did she? Well, that's good.

687
00:45:17,390 --> 00:45:19,599
I must write to her
sometime and say thanks.

688
00:45:21,936 --> 00:45:24,270
Now, which doll should we give
Daisy's little friend Emily?

689
00:45:24,355 --> 00:45:25,939
The one that looks
like a transvestite

690
00:45:26,023 --> 00:45:28,400
or the one that looks
like a dominatrix?

691
00:45:29,819 --> 00:45:32,862
It's almost enough
to make you feel patriotic,

692
00:45:32,947 --> 00:45:35,198
so here's one for our
ass-kicking prime minister.

693
00:45:35,282 --> 00:45:36,700
I think he'll enjoy this.

694
00:45:36,784 --> 00:45:39,452
A golden oldie for
a golden oldie.

695
00:46:29,503 --> 00:46:31,337
Yeah...

696
00:46:31,672 --> 00:46:33,339
Mary, I've been thinking,

697
00:46:33,466 --> 00:46:36,760
can we move the Japanese
ambassador to 4:00 tomorrow?

698
00:46:36,844 --> 00:46:37,844
Certainly, sir.

699
00:46:37,928 --> 00:46:39,846
Terrific. Thanks so much.

700
00:46:48,481 --> 00:46:50,148
Would you like the last...

701
00:46:54,779 --> 00:46:56,780
That's all right, more for me.

702
00:47:00,701 --> 00:47:03,286
I'm very lucky I've got one
of those constitutions

703
00:47:03,370 --> 00:47:04,913
where I never put on weight.

704
00:47:07,625 --> 00:47:08,792
Hello.

705
00:47:18,219 --> 00:47:20,512
Sorry.

706
00:47:24,225 --> 00:47:25,683
Hello?

707
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:42,992
Thank you.

708
00:47:45,287 --> 00:47:46,913
No. Hold on.

709
00:47:47,206 --> 00:47:49,874
God, it's half the book. No.

710
00:47:49,959 --> 00:47:53,253
Just leave them, please!
They're not important.

711
00:47:53,462 --> 00:47:56,089
They're not worth it!

712
00:47:56,423 --> 00:47:58,550
Stop! Stop.

713
00:48:03,013 --> 00:48:05,098
It's all just rubbish.

714
00:48:06,976 --> 00:48:09,060
Just leave it.

715
00:48:21,115 --> 00:48:22,782
God, she's in.

716
00:48:24,451 --> 00:48:28,037
Right. And now she'll think I'm a
total spaz if I don't go in too.

717
00:48:35,087 --> 00:48:37,297
Fuck, it's freezing! Fuck!

718
00:48:41,677 --> 00:48:44,345
It's not worth it. This
isn't bloody Shakespeare.

719
00:48:49,184 --> 00:48:50,476
Just stop. Stop.

720
00:48:53,898 --> 00:48:55,398
I really must do copies.

721
00:48:56,984 --> 00:48:59,145
There'd better not be eels in here.
I can't stand eels.

722
00:49:02,323 --> 00:49:04,240
Oh, God, what the hell is that?

723
00:49:14,418 --> 00:49:16,628
Thank you. Thank you so much.

724
00:49:21,342 --> 00:49:23,676
I know. I'll name one of
the characters after you.

725
00:49:32,144 --> 00:49:35,188
Or I could give you
5% of the profits.

726
00:49:51,622 --> 00:49:53,957
Yes. It's...

727
00:49:59,797 --> 00:50:02,256
Crime. Crime, murder.

728
00:50:05,302 --> 00:50:08,262
Scary? Yes, sometimes scary.

729
00:50:08,430 --> 00:50:12,850
And sometimes not. Mainly
scary how bad the writing is.

730
00:50:33,872 --> 00:50:34,998
Sure.

731
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:42,255
It's my favorite time of day,

732
00:50:42,589 --> 00:50:44,590
driving you.

733
00:50:57,104 --> 00:50:58,688
Sorry.

734
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:29,552
And coming up later
this morning, it's this guy...

735
00:51:35,476 --> 00:51:37,643
The bad granddad
of rock and roll,

736
00:51:37,728 --> 00:51:40,313
here at 1 0:30. Do
not switch off.

737
00:51:46,862 --> 00:51:48,362
Banoffee pie?

738
00:51:48,447 --> 00:51:50,156
No, thanks.

739
00:51:50,449 --> 00:51:53,701
Thank God. You would've broken
my heart if you'd said yes.

740
00:51:53,786 --> 00:51:57,038
Right, well, lucky you.

741
00:51:57,623 --> 00:51:59,415
Can I come in?

742
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:01,250
Yeah, well, I'm a bit busy...

743
00:52:01,335 --> 00:52:03,503
Well, I was just
passing, and I thought

744
00:52:03,587 --> 00:52:05,880
we might check that
video thing out.

745
00:52:06,215 --> 00:52:08,966
I thought I might be able
to swap it for some pie

746
00:52:09,051 --> 00:52:11,344
or maybe Munchies?

747
00:52:11,637 --> 00:52:13,971
Actually, I was being serious.
I don't know where it is.

748
00:52:14,056 --> 00:52:16,224
I'll have a poke
around tonight then...

749
00:52:16,308 --> 00:52:19,102
Mark, can I say something?

750
00:52:19,186 --> 00:52:21,187
Yeah.

751
00:52:22,189 --> 00:52:24,524
I know you're Peter's
best friend,

752
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:29,862
and I know you've never
particularly warmed to me.

753
00:52:30,030 --> 00:52:31,989
No, don't argue.

754
00:52:32,950 --> 00:52:35,201
We've never got friendly.

755
00:52:35,452 --> 00:52:37,870
But I just wanted to say,
I hope that can change.

756
00:52:37,955 --> 00:52:39,789
I'm nice. I really am.

757
00:52:39,873 --> 00:52:42,041
Apart from my terrible
taste in pie and...

758
00:52:43,377 --> 00:52:46,003
Lt would be great if
we could be friends.

759
00:52:46,713 --> 00:52:48,714
Absolutely. Absolutely.

760
00:52:52,469 --> 00:52:53,678
Great.

761
00:52:54,847 --> 00:52:57,723
Doesn't mean we'll be able
to find the video, though.

762
00:52:57,808 --> 00:52:59,767
I had a real search
when you first called

763
00:52:59,852 --> 00:53:01,519
and couldn't find any
trace of it so...

764
00:53:01,603 --> 00:53:04,689
Well, there's one here that says,
"Peter and Juliet's Wedding."

765
00:53:04,773 --> 00:53:06,941
Do you think we might
be on the right track?

766
00:53:07,067 --> 00:53:11,696
Yeah, well... Wow.
That could be it.

767
00:53:11,989 --> 00:53:13,030
Do you mind if I just...

768
00:53:13,115 --> 00:53:14,115
I've probably taped over it.

769
00:53:14,199 --> 00:53:17,201
Almost everything has episodes
of West Wing on it and...

770
00:53:22,583 --> 00:53:24,584
Oh, bingo.

771
00:53:26,211 --> 00:53:28,379
That's lovely.

772
00:53:28,463 --> 00:53:30,548
Well done, you.

773
00:53:31,967 --> 00:53:34,093
That's gorgeous.

774
00:53:35,721 --> 00:53:39,682
Thank you so much, Mark. This is
exactly what I was hoping for.

775
00:53:46,732 --> 00:53:48,900
I look quite pretty.

776
00:53:55,782 --> 00:53:57,533
You've stayed rather
close, haven't you?

777
00:54:52,547 --> 00:54:53,965
They're all of me.

778
00:54:58,971 --> 00:55:01,889
Yeah. Yeah.

779
00:55:01,974 --> 00:55:03,975
Yes.

780
00:55:34,381 --> 00:55:36,340
But

781
00:55:37,342 --> 00:55:39,427
you never talk to me.

782
00:55:41,847 --> 00:55:43,848
You always talk to Peter.

783
00:55:46,601 --> 00:55:48,728
You don't like me.

784
00:55:50,063 --> 00:55:52,023
I hope it's useful.

785
00:55:52,149 --> 00:55:55,067
Don't show it around too much.

786
00:55:55,193 --> 00:55:58,237
Needs a bit of editing.

787
00:55:58,405 --> 00:56:01,991
Look, I've got to
get to a lunch.

788
00:56:02,242 --> 00:56:04,076
Early lunch.

789
00:56:04,286 --> 00:56:07,163
You can just show
yourself out, can't you?

790
00:56:12,878 --> 00:56:17,048
It's a self-preservation
thing, you see.

791
00:57:16,817 --> 00:57:17,942
Yeah.

792
00:57:20,987 --> 00:57:23,864
Annie, my darling,
my dream, my boat.

793
00:57:27,494 --> 00:57:28,953
Need you to do a favor for me.

794
00:57:29,037 --> 00:57:32,164
Of course. Anything for
the hero of the hour.

795
00:57:33,834 --> 00:57:36,919
Don't ask me why, and for heaven's
sake, don't read stuff into this,

796
00:57:37,003 --> 00:57:39,255
it's just a weird
personality thing.

797
00:57:39,464 --> 00:57:42,383
But you know Natalie
who works here?

798
00:57:43,176 --> 00:57:45,136
The chubby girl?

799
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:47,221
Would we call her chubby?

800
00:57:47,472 --> 00:57:50,224
I think there's a pretty
sizeable ass there, yes, sir.

801
00:57:50,934 --> 00:57:52,226
Huge thighs.

802
00:57:53,019 --> 00:57:55,980
Yeah. Well, whatever.

803
00:57:57,232 --> 00:58:01,026
I'm sure she's a lovely girl,
but I wonder if you could

804
00:58:03,697 --> 00:58:05,364
redistribute her?

805
00:58:06,741 --> 00:58:08,742
It's done.

806
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:45,905
Hey, Sammo. Can't sleep?

807
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:48,949
I got some terrible news today.

808
00:58:49,034 --> 00:58:50,910
Let's have it.

809
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:52,912
Joanna's going back to America.

810
00:58:52,996 --> 00:58:54,163
Your girl's American?

811
00:58:54,247 --> 00:58:56,499
Yes, she's American.

812
00:58:56,583 --> 00:58:58,834
And she's not my girl.

813
00:58:59,085 --> 00:59:00,753
And she's going back to America.

814
00:59:00,837 --> 00:59:03,005
That's the end of my
life as I know it.

815
00:59:03,089 --> 00:59:05,341
That is bad news.

816
00:59:07,552 --> 00:59:09,845
Well, we need Kate

817
00:59:09,971 --> 00:59:12,806
and we need Leo, and
we need them now.

818
00:59:13,683 --> 00:59:14,934
Come on.

819
00:59:19,064 --> 00:59:21,273
Hold on. Hold on.

820
00:59:21,483 --> 00:59:23,734
Keep your eyes closed.

821
00:59:23,818 --> 00:59:25,569
Do you trust me?

822
00:59:25,654 --> 00:59:27,613
I trust you.

823
00:59:28,949 --> 00:59:30,199
Do you trust me?

824
00:59:30,283 --> 00:59:31,492
I trust you.

825
00:59:31,576 --> 00:59:32,868
Fool!

826
00:59:32,953 --> 00:59:34,411
Get off, you big bully.

827
00:59:36,665 --> 00:59:39,667
All right, open your eyes.

828
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:46,757
You know, Sammy, I'm sure she's
unique and extraordinary,

829
00:59:47,759 --> 00:59:49,677
but general wisdom
is that in the end,

830
00:59:49,761 --> 00:59:52,096
there isn't just one
person for each of us.

831
00:59:54,391 --> 00:59:56,350
There was for Kate and Leo.

832
00:59:57,018 --> 00:59:59,186
There was for you.

833
00:59:59,271 --> 01:00:01,146
And there is for me.

834
01:00:01,231 --> 01:00:03,148
She's the one.

835
01:00:04,859 --> 01:00:07,653
Fair enough. And
her name's Joanna?

836
01:00:08,488 --> 01:00:11,532
Yeah, I know. Same as Mom.

837
01:00:22,127 --> 01:00:23,210
Yeah.

838
01:00:27,549 --> 01:00:29,133
Prime Minister.

839
01:00:29,217 --> 01:00:30,551
Thank you very much.

840
01:01:22,187 --> 01:01:24,647
Well, goodbye.

841
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:32,071
Lt was...

842
01:02:45,645 --> 01:02:49,690
You know I love
Christmas, I always will

843
01:02:51,151 --> 01:02:55,487
My mind's made up,
the way that I feel

844
01:02:56,823 --> 01:03:01,160
There's no beginning,
there'll be no end

845
01:03:13,006 --> 01:03:15,007
Daniel!

846
01:03:16,092 --> 01:03:17,551
I have a plan.

847
01:03:17,635 --> 01:03:20,012
Thank the Lord! Tell me.

848
01:03:20,513 --> 01:03:23,849
Well, girls love musicians,
don't they? Uh-huh.

849
01:03:23,975 --> 01:03:26,435
Even the really weird ones get girlfriends.
That's right.

850
01:03:26,519 --> 01:03:28,604
Meat Loaf definitely got
laid at least once.

851
01:03:28,688 --> 01:03:31,732
For God's sake, Ringo Starr
married a Bond girl.

852
01:03:33,067 --> 01:03:36,945
Whatever. There's this big concert at
the end of term and Joanna's in it.

853
01:03:37,155 --> 01:03:40,783
And I thought maybe if I was in the
band and played absolutely superbly,

854
01:03:40,867 --> 01:03:43,118
there's a chance that she might
actually fall in love with me.

855
01:03:43,203 --> 01:03:44,244
What do you think?

856
01:03:44,329 --> 01:03:46,872
I think it's brilliant.
I think it's stellar.

857
01:03:46,956 --> 01:03:50,709
Apart from the one obvious tiny,
little, baby, little hiccup.

858
01:03:51,377 --> 01:03:53,170
I don't play a
musical instrument?

859
01:03:53,254 --> 01:03:54,338
Yes, sir.

860
01:03:55,131 --> 01:03:57,090
A tiny, insignificant detail.

861
01:04:34,963 --> 01:04:37,422
I suppose I'd better go
and do the duty round.

862
01:04:37,507 --> 01:04:39,508
You're a saint.

863
01:04:46,724 --> 01:04:49,184
Any chance of a dance
with the boss?

864
01:04:50,395 --> 01:04:52,563
Yeah, sure, sure.

865
01:04:52,856 --> 01:04:55,107
As long as your
boyfriend doesn't mind.

866
01:04:57,986 --> 01:04:59,945
Not my boyfriend.

867
01:05:15,086 --> 01:05:17,462
You're looking very
pretty tonight.

868
01:05:19,299 --> 01:05:21,300
It's for you.

869
01:05:22,927 --> 01:05:24,928
Sorry?

870
01:05:27,432 --> 01:05:29,516
It's all for you, sir.

871
01:05:52,165 --> 01:05:54,541
This must be a very
exciting moment for you,

872
01:05:54,626 --> 01:05:56,668
fighting for the
Christmas number one.

873
01:05:56,753 --> 01:05:58,253
How's it looking so far?

874
01:05:58,338 --> 01:05:59,713
Very bad indeed.

875
01:06:00,423 --> 01:06:03,091
Blue are outselling
me five-to-one,

876
01:06:03,176 --> 01:06:05,510
but I'm hoping for a late surge.

877
01:06:06,846 --> 01:06:09,348
And, if I reach number one,

878
01:06:09,432 --> 01:06:15,187
I promise to sing a song stark
naked on TV on Christmas Eve.

879
01:06:16,522 --> 01:06:17,606
Do you mean that?

880
01:06:17,690 --> 01:06:18,857
Well, of course I
mean it, Michael.

881
01:06:18,942 --> 01:06:21,568
Do you want a preview?
You old flirt.

882
01:06:25,907 --> 01:06:27,616
That'll never make number one.

883
01:06:34,415 --> 01:06:37,960
I suppose it's his job to dance
with everyone, isn't it?

884
01:06:38,378 --> 01:06:40,462
Some more than others.

885
01:06:43,841 --> 01:06:45,676
Just one dance?

886
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:47,469
Before we run out of chances.

887
01:06:47,553 --> 01:06:49,137
Who, me?

888
01:06:49,222 --> 01:06:50,931
Unless you just...

889
01:06:51,015 --> 01:06:53,308
No! No! Good.

890
01:06:53,393 --> 01:06:55,435
Yes. Thanks.

891
01:08:24,776 --> 01:08:26,818
Well, then. I'd better go.

892
01:08:26,986 --> 01:08:28,987
Okay.

893
01:08:30,531 --> 01:08:32,657
Good night. Good night.

894
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:51,718
Actually,

895
01:08:51,803 --> 01:08:53,970
I don't have to go. Right. Good.

896
01:08:54,138 --> 01:08:56,223
I mean... No, that's good.

897
01:08:57,350 --> 01:09:00,852
Just... Would you excuse
me for one second?

898
01:09:01,020 --> 01:09:03,522
Sure. Just one second.

899
01:09:11,197 --> 01:09:13,824
Okay, that's done.

900
01:09:16,244 --> 01:09:19,704
Why don't you come upstairs
in about 1 0 seconds?

901
01:09:19,872 --> 01:09:22,040
Ten seconds. Ten seconds.

902
01:10:22,476 --> 01:10:23,894
Just tug it.

903
01:10:23,978 --> 01:10:25,103
Okay.

904
01:10:46,751 --> 01:10:48,126
You're beautiful.

905
01:11:12,652 --> 01:11:14,819
I'd better answer that.

906
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:22,202
Hello. Hi. Hello, darling.

907
01:11:22,286 --> 01:11:25,163
No, no, I'm not busy.
No, fire away.

908
01:11:26,165 --> 01:11:27,999
Right.

909
01:11:28,501 --> 01:11:32,337
Yes, I... I'm not quite
sure it's gonna be possible

910
01:11:32,421 --> 01:11:34,965
to get the Pope on the
phone tonight but...

911
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:41,596
Yes. Yes, I'm sure he's very
good at exorcism but...

912
01:11:45,184 --> 01:11:47,686
Well, I'm sure

913
01:11:47,853 --> 01:11:51,398
Jon Bon Jovi is as well, and
I'll definitely look into it.

914
01:11:51,732 --> 01:11:55,235
Okay? Okay, I'll
talk to you later.

915
01:11:55,361 --> 01:11:57,362
All right, bye-bye.

916
01:12:02,743 --> 01:12:04,703
Sorry about that.

917
01:12:04,787 --> 01:12:06,538
No, it's fine.

918
01:12:06,664 --> 01:12:09,541
It's my brother. He's not well.
He calls a lot.

919
01:12:11,877 --> 01:12:14,129
I'm sorry. No, it's fine.
It's fine.

920
01:12:14,213 --> 01:12:17,424
I mean, it's not really fine.
Lt is what it is,

921
01:12:17,508 --> 01:12:21,052
and sort of there being no parents
now, and us being over here,

922
01:12:21,137 --> 01:12:24,139
it's my job to keep an eye on him.
I mean, not my job.

923
01:12:24,223 --> 01:12:26,266
Obviously, I'm glad to do it...

924
01:12:26,809 --> 01:12:28,143
That's okay.

925
01:12:28,227 --> 01:12:32,063
I mean, life is full of
interruptions and complications.

926
01:12:34,358 --> 01:12:35,942
So...

927
01:12:52,918 --> 01:12:54,919
Will it make him better?

928
01:12:56,255 --> 01:12:58,006
No.

929
01:12:58,090 --> 01:13:00,091
Then maybe

930
01:13:00,926 --> 01:13:02,927
don't answer.

931
01:13:10,603 --> 01:13:12,979
Hey. How you doing?

932
01:13:13,773 --> 01:13:16,608
Right, right. No, please.

933
01:13:17,109 --> 01:13:20,195
Please, please, don't,
little darling.

934
01:13:20,279 --> 01:13:24,866
Between the two of us we'll find the
answer and it won't hurt anymore.

935
01:13:24,950 --> 01:13:28,953
No, no. No, I'm not busy. I...

936
01:13:30,581 --> 01:13:33,917
Of course if you want
me to come over I will.

937
01:13:35,753 --> 01:13:37,587
Okay.

938
01:13:47,223 --> 01:13:49,474
That was a good night.

939
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:51,059
Except I felt fat.

940
01:13:51,143 --> 01:13:52,268
Don't be ridiculous.

941
01:13:52,353 --> 01:13:53,895
It's true.

942
01:13:53,979 --> 01:13:58,066
Nowadays the only clothes I can get
into were once owned by Pavarotti.

943
01:13:58,150 --> 01:14:00,985
I always think Pavarotti
dresses very well.

944
01:14:04,824 --> 01:14:06,825
Mia's very pretty.

945
01:14:08,828 --> 01:14:10,829
Is she?

946
01:14:12,289 --> 01:14:15,083
You know she is, darling.

947
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:17,293
Be careful there.

948
01:14:40,443 --> 01:14:43,194
Have you been
watching stuff on TV?

949
01:14:45,156 --> 01:14:46,281
Yeah.

950
01:14:47,491 --> 01:14:49,367
Every night. Good.

951
01:14:49,452 --> 01:14:51,536
And every day.

952
01:14:58,669 --> 01:14:59,961
The nurses are
trying to kill me.

953
01:15:00,045 --> 01:15:01,754
Nobody's trying to
kill you, babe.

954
01:15:09,722 --> 01:15:11,723
Thank you.

955
01:15:14,643 --> 01:15:16,978
Don't do that, my darling.

956
01:15:19,231 --> 01:15:21,232
Thank you.

957
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:30,283
Don't do that.

958
01:16:03,442 --> 01:16:05,818
Right. Back at 3:00.
Christmas shopping,

959
01:16:05,903 --> 01:16:07,612
never an easy or
a pleasant task.

960
01:16:07,696 --> 01:16:09,113
Are you gonna get me something?

961
01:16:14,411 --> 01:16:16,371
I don't know, I hadn't thought.

962
01:16:16,956 --> 01:16:18,331
And where's Sarah, by the way?

963
01:16:18,415 --> 01:16:21,125
She couldn't make it in today.
Family thing.

964
01:16:21,252 --> 01:16:24,712
There's a word for hangover
I've never heard before.

965
01:16:25,297 --> 01:16:26,548
See you later.

966
01:16:26,632 --> 01:16:29,300
Yes. Looking forward to it.

967
01:16:32,429 --> 01:16:34,430
A lot.

968
01:16:46,735 --> 01:16:48,820
So are you gonna
give me something?

969
01:16:49,822 --> 01:16:52,407
I thought I made it
clear last night.

970
01:16:52,491 --> 01:16:55,118
When it comes to me, you
can have everything.

971
01:16:56,453 --> 01:16:59,747
So, what do you need?

972
01:17:01,166 --> 01:17:05,003
Something along the stationery line?
Are you short of staplers?

973
01:17:05,421 --> 01:17:08,631
No. I don't want
something I need.

974
01:17:08,716 --> 01:17:12,176
I want something I want,
something pretty.

975
01:17:13,345 --> 01:17:13,845
Right.

976
01:17:25,899 --> 01:17:29,402
Sorry I'm late. I had to drop
off Bernie at rehearsal.

977
01:17:33,532 --> 01:17:36,034
Right, well, listen, you keep
yourself occupied for 1 0 minutes

978
01:17:36,118 --> 01:17:39,162
while I go and do the boring
stuff for our mothers.

979
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:03,561
Thank you. Thank you.

980
01:18:03,687 --> 01:18:06,147
Looking for anything
in particular, sir?

981
01:18:06,231 --> 01:18:09,651
Yes. That necklace
there, how much is it?

982
01:18:10,069 --> 01:18:12,153
It's £270.

983
01:18:13,781 --> 01:18:16,532
All right. I'll have it.

984
01:18:16,617 --> 01:18:17,742
Lovely.

985
01:18:20,746 --> 01:18:23,748
Would you like it gift-wrapped?

986
01:18:24,458 --> 01:18:25,833
Yes, all right.

987
01:18:25,918 --> 01:18:27,210
Lovely.

988
01:18:29,672 --> 01:18:31,798
Let me just pop it in the box.

989
01:18:33,967 --> 01:18:35,259
There.

990
01:18:35,344 --> 01:18:37,845
Look, could we be quite quick?

991
01:18:37,930 --> 01:18:39,347
Certainly, sir.

992
01:18:39,431 --> 01:18:42,266
Ready in the flashiest
of flashes.

993
01:18:49,274 --> 01:18:50,775
There. That's great.

994
01:18:51,151 --> 01:18:53,945
Not quite finished.

995
01:18:56,824 --> 01:18:58,324
Look, actually, I
don't need a bag.

996
01:18:58,409 --> 01:18:59,867
I'll just put it in my pocket.

997
01:18:59,952 --> 01:19:01,411
This isn't a bag, sir.

998
01:19:02,162 --> 01:19:03,246
Really?

999
01:19:03,330 --> 01:19:05,415
This is so much more than a bag.

1000
01:19:28,439 --> 01:19:30,648
Could we be quite quick, please?

1001
01:19:52,379 --> 01:19:53,463
What's that?

1002
01:19:53,547 --> 01:19:55,047
It's a cinnamon stick, sir.

1003
01:19:55,591 --> 01:19:57,133
Actually, I really can't wait.

1004
01:19:57,217 --> 01:19:58,718
You won't regret it, sir.

1005
01:19:58,802 --> 01:20:00,428
Want to bet?

1006
01:20:00,512 --> 01:20:03,014
'Tis but the work of a moment.

1007
01:20:06,727 --> 01:20:08,853
There we go. Almost finished.

1008
01:20:09,188 --> 01:20:10,749
Almost finished? What
else can there be?

1009
01:20:10,814 --> 01:20:12,190
Are you gonna dip it in yogurt?

1010
01:20:12,274 --> 01:20:13,608
Cover it with chocolate buttons?

1011
01:20:13,692 --> 01:20:16,652
No, sir, we're going to pop
it in the Christmas box.

1012
01:20:16,862 --> 01:20:18,279
But I don't want
a Christmas box.

1013
01:20:18,363 --> 01:20:19,614
But you said you wanted
it gift-wrapped.

1014
01:20:19,698 --> 01:20:20,782
I did but...

1015
01:20:20,866 --> 01:20:22,241
This is the final flourish.

1016
01:20:22,326 --> 01:20:23,326
Can I just pay?

1017
01:20:23,410 --> 01:20:24,535
All we need now...

1018
01:20:24,620 --> 01:20:25,953
Oh, God.

1019
01:20:26,038 --> 01:20:27,038
Is a sprig of holly.

1020
01:20:27,122 --> 01:20:28,331
No, no, no, no.

1021
01:20:28,415 --> 01:20:30,249
No bloody holly. But, sir...

1022
01:20:30,334 --> 01:20:31,655
Leave it. Leave it.
Just leave it.

1023
01:20:33,045 --> 01:20:34,629
Loitering around the
jewelry section, I see.

1024
01:20:34,713 --> 01:20:36,464
No. I was just looking around.

1025
01:20:36,548 --> 01:20:39,425
Don't worry. My expectations
are not that high

1026
01:20:39,510 --> 01:20:42,887
after 1 3 years of Mr. Oh-
but-you-always-love-scarves.

1027
01:20:43,555 --> 01:20:45,556
Actually, I do love this one.

1028
01:20:56,276 --> 01:20:57,318
Hey!

1029
01:20:57,402 --> 01:20:59,445
What are you doing here?

1030
01:20:59,863 --> 01:21:02,740
Had to rent out my flat
to pay for my ticket.

1031
01:21:02,825 --> 01:21:06,118
You're not actually going ahead
with this genuinely stupid plan?

1032
01:21:06,286 --> 01:21:07,912
Yeah. I bloody am.

1033
01:21:07,996 --> 01:21:11,541
You think this backpack is full of clothes?
Like hell it is.

1034
01:21:11,750 --> 01:21:14,377
It is chock-a-block
full of condoms.

1035
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:18,297
Excellent. Excellent.
Perfect, keep that going.

1036
01:21:19,591 --> 01:21:24,345
Look, sorry to be a bit
forward and all that,

1037
01:21:24,429 --> 01:21:26,848
but you don't fancy going for
a Christmas drink, do you?

1038
01:21:26,932 --> 01:21:29,058
I mean, nothing implied at all.

1039
01:21:29,142 --> 01:21:34,313
Just maybe go and see something
Christmassy or something.

1040
01:21:34,439 --> 01:21:37,733
Obviously, if you don't want
to, you don't have to. I...

1041
01:21:37,818 --> 01:21:39,360
I'm rambling now, sorry.

1042
01:21:39,820 --> 01:21:42,446
No. That would be lovely.

1043
01:21:42,948 --> 01:21:45,157
Great.

1044
01:21:48,996 --> 01:21:51,038
You know, that is really great.

1045
01:21:51,123 --> 01:21:52,915
Normally, I'm really shy
about this sort of thing.

1046
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,668
Takes me ages to get the
courage up, so thank you.

1047
01:22:02,509 --> 01:22:04,385
Explain to me again
why you're so late.

1048
01:22:04,469 --> 01:22:07,638
For heaven's sake, woman,
can't a man have any secrets?

1049
01:22:07,848 --> 01:22:11,893
We've been waiting for hours.
It's the first ever preview.

1050
01:22:20,736 --> 01:22:24,739
Lt was a starry
night in ancient Jerusalem

1051
01:22:24,823 --> 01:22:27,867
and the baby Jesus
was in his manger.

1052
01:22:36,209 --> 01:22:39,670
Sherlock Holmes is not
a real detective.

1053
01:22:43,008 --> 01:22:46,218
I would like
half-pint of sherry.

1054
01:22:47,179 --> 01:22:49,805
I would like a
one-day travel card.

1055
01:22:55,687 --> 01:22:58,814
Milton Keynes has
many roundabouts.

1056
01:23:22,172 --> 01:23:23,839
You'll come back a broken man.

1057
01:23:23,924 --> 01:23:26,926
Yeah, back broken
from too much sex.

1058
01:23:27,010 --> 01:23:29,220
You are on the road to disaster.

1059
01:23:29,388 --> 01:23:32,848
No, I am on shag
highway, heading west.

1060
01:23:33,225 --> 01:23:35,559
Farewell, failure.

1061
01:23:35,644 --> 01:23:39,438
America, watch out! Here
comes Colin Frissell.

1062
01:23:40,023 --> 01:23:43,317
And he's got a big knob.

1063
01:23:53,745 --> 01:23:54,954
Take me to a bar.

1064
01:23:55,038 --> 01:23:56,330
What kind of bar?

1065
01:23:56,415 --> 01:23:59,792
Just any bar. Just your
average American bar.

1066
01:24:07,175 --> 01:24:08,175
Can I help you?

1067
01:24:08,260 --> 01:24:10,803
Yes. I'd like a
Budweiser, please.

1068
01:24:10,887 --> 01:24:12,430
King of beers.

1069
01:24:12,514 --> 01:24:13,848
One Bud coming up.

1070
01:24:15,142 --> 01:24:16,600
Oh, my God.

1071
01:24:18,061 --> 01:24:19,770
Are you from England?

1072
01:24:20,856 --> 01:24:21,939
Yes.

1073
01:24:23,859 --> 01:24:26,610
That is so cute.

1074
01:24:26,695 --> 01:24:28,821
Hi, I'm Stacey.

1075
01:24:30,449 --> 01:24:32,450
Jeannie?

1076
01:24:34,411 --> 01:24:35,703
Yeah?

1077
01:24:36,413 --> 01:24:38,289
This is...

1078
01:24:38,498 --> 01:24:39,749
Colin.

1079
01:24:41,293 --> 01:24:43,210
Frissell.

1080
01:24:43,295 --> 01:24:45,129
Cute name.

1081
01:24:45,213 --> 01:24:46,922
Jeannie.

1082
01:24:47,007 --> 01:24:48,215
He's from England.

1083
01:24:48,300 --> 01:24:50,384
Yep. Basildon.

1084
01:24:53,472 --> 01:24:56,599
Wait till Carol-Anne gets here.

1085
01:24:56,683 --> 01:24:58,309
She's crazy about English guys.

1086
01:25:03,648 --> 01:25:04,940
Hey, girls.

1087
01:25:05,025 --> 01:25:07,359
Carol-Anne, come meet Colin.

1088
01:25:07,444 --> 01:25:09,028
He's from England.

1089
01:25:10,697 --> 01:25:14,784
Well, step aside, ladies.
This one's on me.

1090
01:25:17,537 --> 01:25:19,288
Hey, gorgeous.

1091
01:25:22,084 --> 01:25:23,751
That is so funny!

1092
01:25:25,295 --> 01:25:27,088
What do you call that?

1093
01:25:27,172 --> 01:25:28,380
Bottle.

1094
01:25:28,465 --> 01:25:30,007
Bottle.

1095
01:25:30,092 --> 01:25:32,051
What about this? Straw.

1096
01:25:32,135 --> 01:25:33,928
Straw.

1097
01:25:34,012 --> 01:25:35,930
What about this? Table.

1098
01:25:37,224 --> 01:25:39,183
Table. The same. It's the same.

1099
01:25:40,018 --> 01:25:41,560
Where are you staying?

1100
01:25:41,645 --> 01:25:43,270
I don't actually know.

1101
01:25:43,355 --> 01:25:45,689
I guess I'll just check into a
motel like they do in the movies.

1102
01:25:45,774 --> 01:25:48,984
Oh, my God. Oh, my
God, that is so cute.

1103
01:25:49,194 --> 01:25:53,614
No, no, no, listen. This may be a
bit pushy 'cause we just met you,

1104
01:25:53,865 --> 01:25:56,283
but why don't you come back
and sleep at our place?

1105
01:25:56,368 --> 01:25:58,536
Yeah.

1106
01:25:58,870 --> 01:26:01,705
Well, I mean, you know, if it's
not too much of an inconvenience.

1107
01:26:01,790 --> 01:26:03,207
Hell no!

1108
01:26:03,291 --> 01:26:04,708
But there's one problem.

1109
01:26:05,418 --> 01:26:07,211
What?

1110
01:26:07,295 --> 01:26:10,714
Well, we're not the richest
of girls, you know.

1111
01:26:10,799 --> 01:26:15,594
So we just have a little
bed and no couch.

1112
01:26:15,762 --> 01:26:19,056
So you'd have to share
with all three of us.

1113
01:26:19,516 --> 01:26:25,437
And on this cold, cold night it's gonna
be crowded and sweaty and stuff.

1114
01:26:25,522 --> 01:26:28,440
And we can't even
afford pajamas.

1115
01:26:29,025 --> 01:26:30,067
No?

1116
01:26:31,069 --> 01:26:34,738
Which means we would be naked.

1117
01:26:40,620 --> 01:26:42,288
No, no, I think it'd be fine.

1118
01:26:42,372 --> 01:26:43,581
Great. Cool.

1119
01:26:44,916 --> 01:26:47,751
The thing that's gonna
make it more crowded...

1120
01:26:48,170 --> 01:26:50,254
Harriet. You haven't
met Harriet.

1121
01:26:50,797 --> 01:26:52,173
There's a fourth one? Yeah.

1122
01:26:52,257 --> 01:26:56,302
Don't worry, you're totally gonna
like her 'cause she is the sexy one.

1123
01:26:56,386 --> 01:26:59,263
Really? Wow. Yeah.

1124
01:26:59,514 --> 01:27:01,724
Praise the Lord!

1125
01:27:01,808 --> 01:27:03,100
And he's a Christian.

1126
01:27:05,770 --> 01:27:07,271
Cheers.

1127
01:27:28,293 --> 01:27:31,545
One present only each tonight.
Who's got one for Dad?

1128
01:27:31,630 --> 01:27:33,339
I have. Let Mommy go first.

1129
01:27:33,423 --> 01:27:34,632
I'll get it. I'll get it.

1130
01:27:34,716 --> 01:27:36,634
No, no, no. I want to choose mine.
I want to choose mine.

1131
01:27:36,718 --> 01:27:38,886
I think I want

1132
01:27:41,097 --> 01:27:42,097
this one.

1133
01:27:42,182 --> 01:27:44,725
I have, of course, bought you
the traditional scarf as well,

1134
01:27:44,809 --> 01:27:48,646
but this is my other, slightly
special, personal one.

1135
01:27:49,147 --> 01:27:51,190
Thank you.

1136
01:27:51,608 --> 01:27:53,400
That's a real first.

1137
01:27:53,485 --> 01:27:54,443
Rip it!

1138
01:27:54,527 --> 01:27:55,736
What is it?

1139
01:27:56,029 --> 01:27:58,614
I'm going to... All
right, I'll rip it.

1140
01:28:05,830 --> 01:28:08,082
God, that's a surprise.

1141
01:28:08,541 --> 01:28:10,334
What is it?

1142
01:28:12,504 --> 01:28:15,839
It's a CD. Joni Mitchell. Wow.

1143
01:28:15,924 --> 01:28:18,592
To continue your
emotional education.

1144
01:28:18,677 --> 01:28:22,554
Yes. Goodness.

1145
01:28:23,515 --> 01:28:25,224
That's great.

1146
01:28:25,475 --> 01:28:27,810
My brilliant wife.

1147
01:28:27,894 --> 01:28:29,061
Yes.

1148
01:28:30,689 --> 01:28:34,942
Actually, do you mind if I just
absent myself for a second?

1149
01:28:35,026 --> 01:28:37,695
All that ice cream.

1150
01:28:38,196 --> 01:28:41,115
Darling, could you just make
sure the kids are ready to go?

1151
01:28:41,199 --> 01:28:42,741
I'll be back in a minute.

1152
01:28:42,826 --> 01:28:44,706
All right, all
right, let's take it easy.

1153
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:46,745
Mine first. Mine.

1154
01:30:44,239 --> 01:30:45,864
Oh, my God.

1155
01:30:45,949 --> 01:30:48,867
It's a miracle.
You're all dressed.

1156
01:30:48,952 --> 01:30:51,870
Come on, come on, come
on, we're horribly late.

1157
01:30:51,955 --> 01:30:53,914
Right, then. Come on. In the car.
Ln the car.

1158
01:30:53,998 --> 01:30:55,290
Come on.

1159
01:31:05,427 --> 01:31:06,927
Has she noticed you yet?

1160
01:31:07,011 --> 01:31:08,512
No.

1161
01:31:08,763 --> 01:31:10,180
You know the thing
about romance is

1162
01:31:10,265 --> 01:31:12,975
people only get together
right at the very end.

1163
01:31:13,059 --> 01:31:15,185
Of course.

1164
01:31:16,688 --> 01:31:20,274
By the way, I feel bad. I never ask
you how your love life is going.

1165
01:31:20,442 --> 01:31:21,692
Uh-huh.

1166
01:31:22,652 --> 01:31:24,403
No.

1167
01:31:24,487 --> 01:31:27,364
As you know, that was
a done deal long ago.

1168
01:31:28,783 --> 01:31:31,410
Unless, of course,
Claudia Schiffer calls,

1169
01:31:31,494 --> 01:31:33,655
in which case I want you out
of the house straightaway,

1170
01:31:33,663 --> 01:31:35,789
you wee motherless mongrel.

1171
01:31:37,041 --> 01:31:41,545
No, no. We'll want to have sex
in every room, including yours.

1172
01:31:41,880 --> 01:31:44,173
It's a rainy
Christmas Eve all over the UK

1173
01:31:44,257 --> 01:31:46,550
and the big question
is who is number one

1174
01:31:46,634 --> 01:31:48,427
on the Radio One
chart show tonight?

1175
01:31:48,511 --> 01:31:52,556
Is it Blue or the unexpected
Christmas sensation from Billy Mack?

1176
01:31:53,016 --> 01:31:56,810
You might have guessed it,
although you may not believe it.

1177
01:31:56,895 --> 01:31:59,021
It's Billy Mack.

1178
01:32:01,649 --> 01:32:03,484
You are the champion!

1179
01:32:03,568 --> 01:32:05,068
Hi, Billy.

1180
01:32:05,153 --> 01:32:06,153
Hello.

1181
01:32:06,237 --> 01:32:09,823
We're live across the nation,
and you're number one.

1182
01:32:09,908 --> 01:32:11,325
How will you be celebrating?

1183
01:32:11,409 --> 01:32:12,618
I don't know.

1184
01:32:12,702 --> 01:32:15,704
Either I could behave like
a real rock and roll loser

1185
01:32:15,997 --> 01:32:18,749
and get drunk with
my fat manager,

1186
01:32:18,833 --> 01:32:20,876
or, when I hang up,

1187
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:25,714
I'll be flooded by invitations to a
large number of glamorous parties.

1188
01:32:26,090 --> 01:32:29,301
Let's hope it's the latter. And here it is.
Number one, from Billy Mack,

1189
01:32:29,385 --> 01:32:31,178
it's Christmas ls All Around.

1190
01:32:31,262 --> 01:32:33,388
Jesus, not that crap again.

1191
01:32:36,851 --> 01:32:39,353
Bill, it's for you, babe.

1192
01:32:40,104 --> 01:32:42,439
Hello. Elton.

1193
01:32:42,524 --> 01:32:45,692
Of course. Of course.

1194
01:32:45,777 --> 01:32:49,154
Send an embarrassingly big
car, and I'll be there.

1195
01:32:51,449 --> 01:32:55,035
It's gonna be a very
good Christmas.

1196
01:33:03,211 --> 01:33:04,211
Right.

1197
01:33:04,295 --> 01:33:07,089
I'd better be getting inside, actually.
My mom and, you know...

1198
01:33:07,173 --> 01:33:09,800
Of course, yeah. It's
getting a bit cold.

1199
01:33:12,720 --> 01:33:14,304
Well, good night.

1200
01:33:14,389 --> 01:33:15,472
Night.

1201
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:26,817
Okay.

1202
01:33:41,332 --> 01:33:44,960
All I want for Christmas is you.

1203
01:33:47,714 --> 01:33:49,840
Right.

1204
01:33:49,924 --> 01:33:53,135
Thank you. Good.

1205
01:33:53,511 --> 01:33:54,720
Good night.

1206
01:34:08,943 --> 01:34:11,320
Look, everyone,
it's Uncle Jamie.

1207
01:34:11,404 --> 01:34:14,114
Hi, Uncle Jamie!

1208
01:34:14,198 --> 01:34:18,285
Yes, splendid. It's
lovely to see you all.

1209
01:34:18,911 --> 01:34:21,413
And...

1210
01:34:22,540 --> 01:34:23,999
I'm off, actually.

1211
01:34:24,375 --> 01:34:27,169
But, Jamie, darling...

1212
01:34:27,253 --> 01:34:29,463
Sorry.

1213
01:34:29,547 --> 01:34:32,174
Man's gotta do what
a man's gotta do.

1214
01:34:35,386 --> 01:34:37,095
I hate Uncle Jamie!

1215
01:34:37,180 --> 01:34:38,805
I hate Uncle Jamie.

1216
01:34:38,890 --> 01:34:40,265
I hate Uncle Jamie.

1217
01:34:51,819 --> 01:34:54,655
Gatwick Airport, please.
Fast as you can.

1218
01:35:09,754 --> 01:35:11,004
Night, Sarah.

1219
01:35:11,089 --> 01:35:12,506
Night, Karl.

1220
01:35:13,549 --> 01:35:15,550
I...

1221
01:35:19,889 --> 01:35:22,933
Merry Christmas.

1222
01:35:42,912 --> 01:35:45,789
Hi, babe. How's it going? Yeah.

1223
01:35:46,082 --> 01:35:48,500
Is it all party, party,
party down there?

1224
01:36:07,353 --> 01:36:09,312
Sam, time for dinner.

1225
01:36:09,397 --> 01:36:10,564
I'm not hungry.

1226
01:36:10,648 --> 01:36:13,942
Sam, I've done chicken kebabs.

1227
01:36:14,193 --> 01:36:16,236
Look at the sign on the door.

1228
01:36:20,491 --> 01:36:21,700
Right.

1229
01:36:28,332 --> 01:36:30,834
It's a little long.

1230
01:36:39,260 --> 01:36:41,261
I'll get it.

1231
01:36:47,643 --> 01:36:49,144
Hi.

1232
01:36:49,228 --> 01:36:50,520
Who is it?

1233
01:36:55,151 --> 01:36:56,985
It's carol singers.

1234
01:36:57,361 --> 01:36:59,362
Give them a quid and
tell them to bugger off.

1235
01:38:12,270 --> 01:38:14,271
Merry Christmas.

1236
01:38:50,808 --> 01:38:52,392
Enough.

1237
01:38:53,644 --> 01:38:55,020
Enough now.

1238
01:39:03,821 --> 01:39:05,572
What the hell are
you doing here?

1239
01:39:05,656 --> 01:39:07,574
You're supposed to
be at Elton John's.

1240
01:39:07,658 --> 01:39:12,621
Well, I was there for a minute or
two, and then I had an epiphany.

1241
01:39:13,164 --> 01:39:15,457
Really? Yeah.

1242
01:39:15,541 --> 01:39:17,542
Come on. Just come up.

1243
01:39:17,668 --> 01:39:20,795
So what was this epiphany?

1244
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:23,590
It was about Christmas.

1245
01:39:24,133 --> 01:39:26,176
You realized it was all around.

1246
01:39:26,260 --> 01:39:29,137
No. I realized that
Christmas is the time

1247
01:39:29,221 --> 01:39:30,472
to be with the people you love.

1248
01:39:32,141 --> 01:39:33,475
Right.

1249
01:39:33,559 --> 01:39:36,770
And I realized that,
as dire chance

1250
01:39:36,854 --> 01:39:39,940
and fateful cock-up
would have it,

1251
01:39:40,024 --> 01:39:43,902
here I am, mid-50s,

1252
01:39:44,528 --> 01:39:47,614
and without knowing it, I've gone
and spent most of my adult life

1253
01:39:47,698 --> 01:39:49,991
with a chubby employee.

1254
01:39:51,702 --> 01:39:54,371
And, much as it
grieves me to say it,

1255
01:39:54,455 --> 01:40:00,085
it might be that the
people I love is, in fact,

1256
01:40:01,379 --> 01:40:02,462
you.

1257
01:40:05,383 --> 01:40:07,384
Well, this is a surprise.

1258
01:40:07,843 --> 01:40:09,302
Yeah.

1259
01:40:09,387 --> 01:40:11,888
Ten minutes at Elton John's,
you're as gay as a Maypole.

1260
01:40:11,973 --> 01:40:13,807
No, look. I'm serious here.

1261
01:40:13,891 --> 01:40:15,767
I left Elton's where there were

1262
01:40:15,851 --> 01:40:18,311
a hefty number of
half-naked chicks

1263
01:40:18,396 --> 01:40:23,233
with their mouths open in order to
hang out with you at Christmas.

1264
01:40:25,569 --> 01:40:26,820
Well, Bill...

1265
01:40:26,904 --> 01:40:30,824
It's a terrible,
terrible mistake, chubs,

1266
01:40:34,996 --> 01:40:38,206
but you turn out to be the
fucking love of my life.

1267
01:40:41,752 --> 01:40:45,505
And to be honest, despite
all my complaining,

1268
01:40:47,591 --> 01:40:49,884
we have had a wonderful life.

1269
01:40:54,765 --> 01:40:56,266
Well,

1270
01:40:58,102 --> 01:40:59,894
thank you.

1271
01:41:01,814 --> 01:41:04,774
I mean, come on,
it's been an honor.

1272
01:41:07,028 --> 01:41:08,987
I feel very proud.

1273
01:41:09,071 --> 01:41:11,114
Look, don't be a moron.

1274
01:41:22,251 --> 01:41:25,503
Come on, let's get
pissed and watch porn.

1275
01:41:44,940 --> 01:41:47,317
Dear sir... Dear David,

1276
01:41:47,568 --> 01:41:50,820
Merry Christmas and I hope you
have a very happy New Year.

1277
01:41:51,030 --> 01:41:53,364
I'm very sorry about the
thing that happened.

1278
01:41:53,574 --> 01:41:56,534
It was a very odd moment and
I feel like a prize idiot.

1279
01:41:56,827 --> 01:41:58,578
Particularly because,

1280
01:41:58,662 --> 01:42:01,247
if you can't say it at
Christmas when can you, eh,

1281
01:42:01,332 --> 01:42:05,043
I'm actually yours. With
love, your Natalie.

1282
01:42:25,356 --> 01:42:27,440
Jack, yeah, I need a car.

1283
01:42:27,525 --> 01:42:29,526
Right now. Thank you.

1284
01:42:41,372 --> 01:42:43,581
Don't wait up.

1285
01:42:47,378 --> 01:42:49,504
I'd like to go to
Wandsworth, the dodgy end.

1286
01:42:49,588 --> 01:42:50,964
Very good, sir.

1287
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:05,311
Harris Street.
What number, sir?

1288
01:43:05,396 --> 01:43:08,148
God, it's the longest
street in the world,

1289
01:43:08,232 --> 01:43:10,108
and I have absolutely no idea.

1290
01:43:18,784 --> 01:43:20,618
Hello. Does Natalie live here?

1291
01:43:21,078 --> 01:43:22,120
No.

1292
01:43:22,204 --> 01:43:24,038
Right, fine. Thank you.
Sorry to disturb.

1293
01:43:24,123 --> 01:43:26,166
Hey, aren't...

1294
01:43:26,417 --> 01:43:29,586
Aren't you the prime minister?

1295
01:43:29,670 --> 01:43:32,922
Yes. Ln fact, I am.
Merry Christmas.

1296
01:43:34,425 --> 01:43:35,675
Part of the service now.

1297
01:43:35,759 --> 01:43:37,844
Trying to get around to
everyone by New Year's Eve.

1298
01:43:43,434 --> 01:43:46,144
Hello. Does Natalie live here?

1299
01:43:46,228 --> 01:43:47,312
No, she doesn't.

1300
01:43:47,396 --> 01:43:48,479
Oh, dear. Okay.

1301
01:43:48,564 --> 01:43:50,523
Are you singing carols?

1302
01:43:50,608 --> 01:43:51,900
No. No, I'm not.

1303
01:43:51,984 --> 01:43:53,776
Please, sir, please.

1304
01:43:53,861 --> 01:43:55,111
Please.

1305
01:43:58,157 --> 01:43:59,949
Well, I suppose I could.

1306
01:44:00,284 --> 01:44:01,951
Please.

1307
01:44:03,162 --> 01:44:04,495
All right.

1308
01:44:07,666 --> 01:44:10,919
Good King Wenceslas looked out

1309
01:44:11,003 --> 01:44:14,547
On the feast of Stephen

1310
01:44:14,632 --> 01:44:17,884
When the snow lay round about

1311
01:44:18,177 --> 01:44:21,429
Deep and crisp and even

1312
01:44:21,680 --> 01:44:25,141
Brightly shone the
moon that night

1313
01:44:26,435 --> 01:44:29,771
Hello. Sorry to disturb.
Does Natalie live here?

1314
01:44:29,855 --> 01:44:32,065
No. She lives next door.

1315
01:44:35,653 --> 01:44:36,653
Ah!

1316
01:44:37,279 --> 01:44:38,529
Brilliant.

1317
01:44:38,614 --> 01:44:40,990
You're not who I think
you are, are you?

1318
01:44:41,075 --> 01:44:43,284
Yes, I'm afraid I am, and I'm
sorry about all the cock-ups.

1319
01:44:43,369 --> 01:44:45,411
Not my fault. My cabinet
are absolute crap.

1320
01:44:45,496 --> 01:44:49,165
We hope to do better next year.
Merry Christmas to you.

1321
01:45:05,599 --> 01:45:06,641
Ah!

1322
01:45:06,725 --> 01:45:10,019
Hello. ls Natalie in?

1323
01:45:10,104 --> 01:45:12,939
Where the fuck is
my fucking coat?

1324
01:45:14,400 --> 01:45:15,441
Oh!

1325
01:45:15,526 --> 01:45:18,528
Hello.

1326
01:45:18,612 --> 01:45:23,491
This is my mom and my dad and my
Uncle Tony and my Auntie Glynne.

1327
01:45:23,575 --> 01:45:25,451
Hello. Very nice to meet you.

1328
01:45:26,036 --> 01:45:29,539
And this is the prime minister.

1329
01:45:29,707 --> 01:45:32,542
Yes, we can see that, darling.

1330
01:45:32,668 --> 01:45:35,211
And, unfortunately,
we're very late.

1331
01:45:35,296 --> 01:45:38,256
It's the school Christmas
concert, you see, David.

1332
01:45:38,507 --> 01:45:40,108
It's the first time
all the local schools

1333
01:45:40,134 --> 01:45:42,010
have joined together, even St.
Basil's...

1334
01:45:42,094 --> 01:45:43,303
Too much detail, Mom.

1335
01:45:43,387 --> 01:45:45,805
Anyway, how can we help, sir?

1336
01:45:46,056 --> 01:45:49,892
Well, I just needed Natalie

1337
01:45:52,563 --> 01:45:54,564
on some state business.

1338
01:45:56,066 --> 01:46:01,154
Right, yes. Of course. Right.

1339
01:46:01,238 --> 01:46:03,740
Well, perhaps you should
come on later, Plumpy.

1340
01:46:04,366 --> 01:46:05,450
Natalie.

1341
01:46:05,534 --> 01:46:07,952
Well, listen, I don't want to
make you late for the concert.

1342
01:46:08,037 --> 01:46:09,662
No, it's nothing, really.

1343
01:46:09,747 --> 01:46:11,289
Keith will be very disappointed.

1344
01:46:11,373 --> 01:46:13,333
No, really, it doesn't matter.

1345
01:46:13,417 --> 01:46:15,752
The octopus costume's
taken me months.

1346
01:46:16,086 --> 01:46:18,004
Eight is a lot of legs, David.

1347
01:46:18,130 --> 01:46:19,130
Hmm.

1348
01:46:22,051 --> 01:46:24,344
Well, listen, why don't
I give you a lift,

1349
01:46:24,428 --> 01:46:29,349
and then we can talk about this
state business business in the car?

1350
01:46:31,769 --> 01:46:32,852
Okay.

1351
01:46:32,936 --> 01:46:34,520
Lovely, yes. Lovely.

1352
01:46:34,605 --> 01:46:35,688
Thank you.

1353
01:46:35,773 --> 01:46:37,774
Hold tight, everybody.

1354
01:46:44,615 --> 01:46:45,907
How far is this place?

1355
01:46:45,991 --> 01:46:47,283
Just round the corner.

1356
01:46:47,368 --> 01:46:50,036
Right. Well...

1357
01:46:51,955 --> 01:46:54,082
I just wanted to say

1358
01:46:56,085 --> 01:46:58,127
thank you for the
Christmas card.

1359
01:46:58,462 --> 01:47:00,046
You're welcome.

1360
01:47:00,297 --> 01:47:02,131
Look, I'm so sorry
about that day.

1361
01:47:02,466 --> 01:47:04,217
I mean, I came into the room
and he slinked towards me

1362
01:47:04,301 --> 01:47:05,385
and there was a fire

1363
01:47:05,469 --> 01:47:07,149
and he's the President
of the United States

1364
01:47:07,179 --> 01:47:09,764
and nothing happened, I promise.

1365
01:47:09,848 --> 01:47:12,850
And I just felt like
such a fool because

1366
01:47:13,268 --> 01:47:16,354
I think about you all
the time, actually.

1367
01:47:16,688 --> 01:47:17,939
And I think you're
the man I really...

1368
01:47:18,023 --> 01:47:20,066
We're here.

1369
01:47:20,150 --> 01:47:21,609
Love. Oh, wow.

1370
01:47:21,693 --> 01:47:24,320
That really was just
round the corner.

1371
01:47:39,670 --> 01:47:41,838
Well, look, I...

1372
01:47:43,590 --> 01:47:45,967
I think I'd better not
come in, you know?

1373
01:47:47,010 --> 01:47:50,430
Last thing anyone wants is some sleazy
politician stealing the kids' thunder.

1374
01:47:50,514 --> 01:47:54,183
No, please come. It'll be great.

1375
01:47:54,643 --> 01:47:57,311
No, I'd... I'd better not.

1376
01:47:58,188 --> 01:48:02,859
But I will be very sorry

1377
01:48:02,943 --> 01:48:04,986
to drive away from you.

1378
01:48:06,572 --> 01:48:08,698
Just give me one second.

1379
01:48:22,754 --> 01:48:25,756
John's been very mysterious.
Where did you two meet?

1380
01:48:32,222 --> 01:48:34,223
No!

1381
01:49:05,797 --> 01:49:08,549
Come on in. We can
watch from backstage.

1382
01:49:09,301 --> 01:49:11,427
Okay. Terry, I won't be long.

1383
01:49:14,806 --> 01:49:18,017
Look, this has to be a
very secret visit, okay?

1384
01:49:18,101 --> 01:49:19,477
Don't worry. This was my school.

1385
01:49:19,561 --> 01:49:21,562
I know my way around. Come on.

1386
01:49:24,942 --> 01:49:27,902
Look, the sheep are ready
already and you're not even...

1387
01:49:27,986 --> 01:49:29,612
David.

1388
01:49:31,949 --> 01:49:34,158
How are you?

1389
01:49:34,451 --> 01:49:38,204
Hi, guys. Hey, hey, hey.
You all right?

1390
01:49:38,664 --> 01:49:40,873
What the hell are
you doing here?

1391
01:49:41,041 --> 01:49:42,041
Well, you know...

1392
01:49:42,125 --> 01:49:43,960
Well, I always tell your
secretary's secretary's secretary

1393
01:49:44,044 --> 01:49:46,712
that these things are going on,
but it never occurred to me

1394
01:49:46,797 --> 01:49:48,381
you'd actually turn up.

1395
01:49:48,465 --> 01:49:50,466
I thought it was
about time I did.

1396
01:49:50,551 --> 01:49:51,717
I just didn't want
anyone to see,

1397
01:49:51,802 --> 01:49:53,922
so I'm gonna hide myself
somewhere and watch the show.

1398
01:49:53,971 --> 01:49:56,389
Good luck, good luck, Daisy.
Good luck, Bernie.

1399
01:49:56,765 --> 01:50:00,226
I have to tell you, I've never been
gladder to see my stupid big brother.

1400
01:50:00,435 --> 01:50:01,561
Thank you.

1401
01:50:01,645 --> 01:50:02,853
All right.

1402
01:50:03,897 --> 01:50:06,566
Now, we haven't been introduced.

1403
01:50:06,900 --> 01:50:09,986
Right. Well, this is Gavin.

1404
01:50:10,070 --> 01:50:11,070
Hello, Gavin.

1405
01:50:11,154 --> 01:50:12,238
My copper.

1406
01:50:12,322 --> 01:50:14,323
And this is Natalie, who's my...

1407
01:50:14,491 --> 01:50:17,118
Who's my catering manager.

1408
01:50:17,703 --> 01:50:19,495
Hi. Catering manager.

1409
01:50:19,580 --> 01:50:21,747
Watch out he keeps
his hands off you.

1410
01:50:21,832 --> 01:50:23,583
Twenty years ago, you'd
have been just his type.

1411
01:50:23,667 --> 01:50:27,420
I'll be very careful. Don't try something,
sir, just because it's Christmas.

1412
01:50:28,964 --> 01:50:30,006
No, seriously.

1413
01:50:31,174 --> 01:50:34,427
Come on. Showtime. Quickly.
Look, see you after, yeah?

1414
01:50:34,511 --> 01:50:36,095
Yeah, probably. Yeah.

1415
01:50:36,179 --> 01:50:38,222
Thank you, Prime Minister.

1416
01:50:38,307 --> 01:50:39,307
It's all right.

1417
01:50:39,391 --> 01:50:40,933
Come on. Right.

1418
01:50:41,018 --> 01:50:44,937
Catch a falling
star and put it in your pocket

1419
01:50:45,272 --> 01:50:49,525
Save it for a rainy day

1420
01:50:49,610 --> 01:50:53,529
Catch a falling star and
put it in your pocket

1421
01:50:53,739 --> 01:51:01,739
Never let it fade away

1422
01:51:15,260 --> 01:51:16,719
Hillier School would
now like to present

1423
01:51:16,803 --> 01:51:18,679
their chosen Christmas number.

1424
01:51:18,764 --> 01:51:21,766
Lead vocals by 1 0-year-old
Joanna Anderson,

1425
01:51:21,850 --> 01:51:26,687
backing vocals coordinated by her
mother, the great Mrs. Jean Anderson.

1426
01:51:27,022 --> 01:51:29,815
Some of the staff have
decided to help out,

1427
01:51:29,900 --> 01:51:34,320
and for this, we ask
you to forgive us.

1428
01:51:34,655 --> 01:51:36,280
Thank you.

1429
01:51:42,079 --> 01:51:45,790
I don't want
a lot for Christmas

1430
01:51:45,874 --> 01:51:50,086
There's just one thing I need

1431
01:51:50,170 --> 01:51:53,297
I don't care about the presents

1432
01:51:53,590 --> 01:51:57,385
Underneath the Christmas tree

1433
01:51:57,511 --> 01:52:00,930
I just want you for my own

1434
01:52:01,223 --> 01:52:04,892
More than you could ever know

1435
01:52:04,976 --> 01:52:08,771
Make my wish come true

1436
01:52:08,939 --> 01:52:12,900
All I want for Christmas

1437
01:52:13,402 --> 01:52:13,902
Is you

1438
01:52:23,078 --> 01:52:25,871
I don't want a lot for Christmas

1439
01:52:25,956 --> 01:52:29,083
There's just one thing I need

1440
01:52:29,543 --> 01:52:32,294
I don't care about the presents

1441
01:52:32,379 --> 01:52:35,423
Underneath the Christmas tree

1442
01:52:35,507 --> 01:52:38,592
I just want you for my own

1443
01:52:38,677 --> 01:52:41,721
More than you could ever know

1444
01:52:41,930 --> 01:52:44,890
Make my wish come true

1445
01:52:45,058 --> 01:52:49,645
All I want for Christmas is you

1446
01:52:51,356 --> 01:52:54,066
You, baby

1447
01:52:54,192 --> 01:52:57,611
All the lights are shining

1448
01:52:57,696 --> 01:53:01,657
So brightly everywhere

1449
01:53:01,783 --> 01:53:05,911
And the sound of children's
laughter fills the air

1450
01:53:05,996 --> 01:53:07,955
Laughter fills the air

1451
01:53:08,039 --> 01:53:09,915
Everyone is singing

1452
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:11,083
Oh, yeah

1453
01:53:11,168 --> 01:53:13,586
I hear those sleigh
bells ringing

1454
01:53:13,670 --> 01:53:16,338
Santa, won't you
bring me my honey?

1455
01:53:16,423 --> 01:53:19,842
Won't you please
bring my baby to me?

1456
01:53:19,926 --> 01:53:23,179
I don't want a lot for Christmas

1457
01:53:23,263 --> 01:53:25,181
This is all I'm asking for

1458
01:53:25,265 --> 01:53:26,724
All I'm asking for

1459
01:53:26,808 --> 01:53:29,560
I just wanna see my baby

1460
01:53:29,644 --> 01:53:32,646
Standing right outside my door

1461
01:53:32,731 --> 01:53:35,357
'Cause I just want
you for my own

1462
01:53:35,942 --> 01:53:37,443
More than you could ever know

1463
01:53:37,527 --> 01:53:39,028
You will ever know

1464
01:53:39,112 --> 01:53:42,198
Make my wish come true

1465
01:53:42,282 --> 01:53:46,243
All I want for Christmas

1466
01:53:46,328 --> 01:53:49,872
Is you

1467
01:53:50,332 --> 01:53:52,500
All I want for Christmas

1468
01:53:52,709 --> 01:53:57,588
And you and you

1469
01:53:57,672 --> 01:54:03,219
All I want for Christmas

1470
01:54:19,820 --> 01:54:21,737
Right.

1471
01:54:24,991 --> 01:54:27,159
So, not quite as
secret as we'd hoped.

1472
01:54:27,244 --> 01:54:28,661
What do we do now?

1473
01:54:28,745 --> 01:54:29,745
Smile.

1474
01:54:30,497 --> 01:54:32,498
Little bow.

1475
01:54:35,919 --> 01:54:37,962
And a wave.

1476
01:54:51,726 --> 01:54:54,562
Absolutely no idea. I
mean, can you imagine?

1477
01:54:54,646 --> 01:54:56,647
I'll see you later, all right?

1478
01:54:56,731 --> 01:54:58,774
I'll speak to you. Bye.

1479
01:55:01,653 --> 01:55:05,614
Tell me, if you were in my
position, what would you do?

1480
01:55:05,949 --> 01:55:07,867
What position is that?

1481
01:55:07,951 --> 01:55:11,745
Imagine your husband
bought a gold necklace

1482
01:55:11,830 --> 01:55:14,832
and, come Christmas, gave
it to somebody else.

1483
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:16,000
Karen...

1484
01:55:16,084 --> 01:55:17,484
Would you wait around
to find out...

1485
01:55:17,544 --> 01:55:18,544
Good night.

1486
01:55:18,628 --> 01:55:19,962
Night, darling. Happy Christmas.

1487
01:55:20,380 --> 01:55:23,382
Would you wait around to find
out if it's just a necklace

1488
01:55:23,466 --> 01:55:25,801
or if it's sex and a necklace

1489
01:55:25,886 --> 01:55:29,346
or if, worst of all, it's
a necklace and love?

1490
01:55:31,016 --> 01:55:32,391
Would you stay?

1491
01:55:32,475 --> 01:55:34,602
Knowing life would always
be a little bit worse?

1492
01:55:36,146 --> 01:55:37,313
Or would you cut and run?

1493
01:55:37,397 --> 01:55:39,565
Oh, God.

1494
01:55:44,237 --> 01:55:46,989
I am so in the wrong.

1495
01:55:47,115 --> 01:55:49,074
A classic fool.

1496
01:55:49,492 --> 01:55:52,494
Yes, but you've also
made a fool out of me.

1497
01:55:52,579 --> 01:55:55,372
You've made the life
I lead foolish, too.

1498
01:55:57,751 --> 01:56:00,586
Darling. Darlings!

1499
01:56:00,670 --> 01:56:04,048
You were wonderful.

1500
01:56:04,132 --> 01:56:06,926
My little lobster,
you were so...

1501
01:56:07,010 --> 01:56:09,178
What is that word?

1502
01:56:09,512 --> 01:56:11,221
Orange.

1503
01:56:11,806 --> 01:56:14,767
Come on, I've got treats at home.
Dad's coming.

1504
01:56:16,394 --> 01:56:20,856
Sammy! Fantastic show!
Classic drumming, Son.

1505
01:56:21,274 --> 01:56:24,193
Thanks. Plan didn't
work, though.

1506
01:56:24,277 --> 01:56:25,277
Tell her, then.

1507
01:56:25,362 --> 01:56:27,196
Tell her what? Tell her
that you love her.

1508
01:56:27,530 --> 01:56:30,324
No way. Anyway,
they fly tonight.

1509
01:56:30,408 --> 01:56:33,786
Even better. Sam, you've
got nothing to lose,

1510
01:56:33,870 --> 01:56:35,537
and you'll always
regret it if you don't.

1511
01:56:37,374 --> 01:56:39,458
I never told your mom enough.

1512
01:56:39,542 --> 01:56:40,834
I should have told
her every day,

1513
01:56:40,919 --> 01:56:43,754
because she was
perfect every day.

1514
01:56:45,090 --> 01:56:49,218
You've seen the films, kiddo.
It ain't over till it's over.

1515
01:56:51,388 --> 01:56:53,889
Okay, Dad. Let's do it.

1516
01:56:54,224 --> 01:56:56,266
Let's go get the shit
kicked out of us by love.

1517
01:56:56,351 --> 01:56:57,434
Yes.

1518
01:56:58,395 --> 01:56:59,561
Just give me one sec.

1519
01:56:59,646 --> 01:57:00,688
Yeah.

1520
01:57:02,065 --> 01:57:03,148
I'm sorry.

1521
01:57:03,233 --> 01:57:04,274
Sorry.

1522
01:57:05,318 --> 01:57:06,944
That's okay.

1523
01:57:07,028 --> 01:57:08,278
My fault.

1524
01:57:08,363 --> 01:57:09,822
No, no, really, it wasn't.

1525
01:57:10,907 --> 01:57:12,574
You're Sam's dad, aren't you?

1526
01:57:13,910 --> 01:57:16,704
Yeah. Stepdad, actually.

1527
01:57:17,747 --> 01:57:19,748
Daniel. I'm Carol.

1528
01:57:19,833 --> 01:57:21,417
Carol.

1529
01:57:21,793 --> 01:57:23,669
Okay, I'm back. Let's go.

1530
01:57:23,753 --> 01:57:26,171
Yeah. Well...

1531
01:57:27,424 --> 01:57:29,591
I hope we'll meet again, Karen.

1532
01:57:29,843 --> 01:57:31,010
Carol.

1533
01:57:33,888 --> 01:57:35,681
I'll make sure we do.

1534
01:57:35,765 --> 01:57:37,725
Yeah? Good.

1535
01:57:46,276 --> 01:57:47,860
Tell her. What?

1536
01:57:47,944 --> 01:57:49,278
You know...

1537
01:57:49,362 --> 01:57:51,280
Don't be such an arse.

1538
01:57:54,826 --> 01:57:56,827
Look, there she is. Where?

1539
01:57:56,911 --> 01:57:58,287
Over there.

1540
01:58:00,999 --> 01:58:02,166
Oh, no.

1541
01:58:03,793 --> 01:58:06,712
It's okay, we'll go to the airport.
I know a shortcut.

1542
01:59:17,242 --> 01:59:19,243
Wait. Wait.

1543
01:59:22,622 --> 01:59:23,914
Oh, no.

1544
01:59:35,718 --> 01:59:36,998
Look, we're not actually flying.

1545
01:59:37,011 --> 01:59:39,096
You can't come through
without a boarding pass.

1546
01:59:39,305 --> 01:59:43,517
Not even to let the boy say
goodbye to the love of his life?

1547
01:59:45,311 --> 01:59:46,395
No.

1548
01:59:49,607 --> 01:59:51,733
I'm sorry, Sam.
Boarding pass, sir?

1549
01:59:52,902 --> 01:59:54,528
Just a moment, I know I've
got it here somewhere.

1550
01:59:54,612 --> 01:59:56,405
Sorry. Would you mind
hanging on to that?

1551
01:59:56,739 --> 01:59:58,490
Unless... What?

1552
01:59:58,575 --> 01:59:59,855
Do you want to
make a run for it?

1553
01:59:59,909 --> 02:00:01,243
Hold on to that, as well.

1554
02:00:01,327 --> 02:00:02,703
You think I should? Yeah.

1555
02:00:02,787 --> 02:00:04,329
Thank you. Hold those.

1556
02:00:04,414 --> 02:00:06,456
Okay.

1557
02:00:06,541 --> 02:00:07,541
Yes!

1558
02:00:07,625 --> 02:00:10,419
No, I must have left them where
I was having a cup of coffee.

1559
02:00:10,503 --> 02:00:11,962
I'm sorry.

1560
02:02:03,992 --> 02:02:05,993
Joanna.

1561
02:02:07,036 --> 02:02:09,037
Sam?

1562
02:02:12,292 --> 02:02:14,126
I thought you didn't
know my name.

1563
02:02:14,210 --> 02:02:15,377
Course I do.

1564
02:02:16,629 --> 02:02:20,257
Oh, Jesus. Here, I've gotta run.

1565
02:05:16,184 --> 02:05:18,185
Thank you.

1566
02:05:20,146 --> 02:05:22,147
That will be nice.

1567
02:05:24,233 --> 02:05:26,985
Yes is being my answer.

1568
02:05:29,322 --> 02:05:30,864
Easy question.

1569
02:05:37,580 --> 02:05:38,788
Bravo!

1570
02:06:05,525 --> 02:06:07,609
You learned English?

1571
02:06:08,110 --> 02:06:10,237
Just in cases.

1572
02:06:51,696 --> 02:06:53,154
Hello, Daisy.

1573
02:06:53,239 --> 02:06:54,781
This one's Greta.

1574
02:06:54,865 --> 02:06:56,074
Hello, Greta.

1575
02:06:57,868 --> 02:07:01,955
Here she is. This is Aurelia.
This is Juliet. This is Peter.

1576
02:07:02,248 --> 02:07:03,790
Mark, hi, didn't see you there.

1577
02:07:03,874 --> 02:07:05,250
Yeah, just thought
I'd tag along.

1578
02:07:05,334 --> 02:07:08,169
Jamie's friends are
so good-looking.

1579
02:07:08,504 --> 02:07:10,630
He never tells me this.

1580
02:07:10,840 --> 02:07:13,925
I think maybe now I have
made the wrong choice,

1581
02:07:14,010 --> 02:07:15,594
picked wrong Englishman.

1582
02:07:15,678 --> 02:07:16,720
She can't speak
English properly.

1583
02:07:16,804 --> 02:07:18,165
She doesn't know
what she's saying.

1584
02:07:18,806 --> 02:07:20,849
Dad! Dad!

1585
02:07:23,060 --> 02:07:24,686
Oh, God.

1586
02:07:24,979 --> 02:07:26,146
Did you get us any presents?

1587
02:07:26,230 --> 02:07:28,148
As a matter of fact, I did.

1588
02:07:28,232 --> 02:07:29,608
Thanks, Dad.

1589
02:07:33,529 --> 02:07:34,613
How are you?

1590
02:07:34,697 --> 02:07:36,531
I'm fine. I'm fine.

1591
02:07:38,409 --> 02:07:40,368
Good to have you back.

1592
02:07:40,453 --> 02:07:42,704
Come on. Home.

1593
02:07:45,708 --> 02:07:47,709
There she is.

1594
02:07:49,295 --> 02:07:51,755
Hi.

1595
02:07:51,839 --> 02:07:53,131
Hello.

1596
02:07:53,215 --> 02:07:55,425
He should have kissed her.
